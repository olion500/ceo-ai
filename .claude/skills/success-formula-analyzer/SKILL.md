## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Case Study Research

```markdown
## Research Checklist

- [ ] Product launch date and timeline
- [ ] Founder background and story
- [ ] Initial problem/opportunity identified
- [ ] MVP features and complexity
- [ ] Launch strategy and channels
- [ ] Early traction metrics
- [ ] Pivot points (if any)
- [ ] Revenue milestones
- [ ] Current state (users, revenue, team)
- [ ] Key challenges overcome
- [ ] Lessons learned (from founder)
```

**Sources to Check:**
- Indie Hackers interviews
- Reddit (r/SideProject, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong)
- Twitter threads by founders
- Podcast interviews
- Blog post-mortems
- GitHub stars/activity (if open source)
- Product Hunt launch data

### Step 2: Extract Success Variables

Identify which variables correlate with success:

**Market Variables:**
- Market size and growth rate
- Competition level
- Customer willingness to pay
- Pain intensity

**Product Variables:**
- Time to build MVP

**Founder Variables:**
- Domain expertise
- Technical skills
- Marketing ability
- Network size
- Available time

**Execution Variables:**

### Step 3: Formula Synthesis

Create a reproducible formula:

```
SUCCESS = (PROBLEM_INTENSITY × MARKET_SIZE) × (SOLUTION_QUALITY × DISTRIBUTION) / (COMPETITION × EXECUTION_DIFFICULTY)

Where:
- PROBLEM_INTENSITY: 1-10 (how badly people need this)
- MARKET_SIZE: Reachable audience size
- SOLUTION_QUALITY: How well you solve the problem
- DISTRIBUTION: Effectiveness of your marketing channels
- COMPETITION: Number of similar solutions
- EXECUTION_DIFFICULTY: Technical + operational complexity
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Anti-Patterns

❌ **Building in Vacuum**
- Not talking to potential customers before building
- Assuming you know what people want
- Over-engineering the first version

❌ **Competitive Markets Without Differentiation**

- Competing on price alone
- No clear reason to switch from existing solutions

❌ **Complex Products for Small Markets**
- Building Salesforce competitor as solo developer
- Requiring months/years of development
- Difficult to support at scale

❌ **No Clear Monetization**
- "We'll figure out how to make money later"
- Relying on ads with small audience
- Underpricing significantly

❌ **Ignoring Distribution**
- "Build it and they will come" mentality
- No plan for customer acquisition
- No existing audience or distribution channel

## Success Metrics to Track

### Early Stage (0-3 months)

- Feature usage metrics
- Customer feedback themes

### Mature Stage (12+ months)
- MRR growth rate
- Churn rate
