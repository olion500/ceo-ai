# Decision Framework

Go/no-go decision criteria based on integrated assessment.

## Real-World Decision Examples

### Example 1: GO ✅ - Privacy-First Analytics for Creators

**Scores:**
- Final Score: 7.45/10
- Idea: 56/80 (70%)
- Success Patterns: 8/10 (found 3 similar cases)
- Feasibility: 7.5/10

**Decision Checklist:**
- [x] Final score >6.5/10 → YES (7.45)
- [x] No critical unmitigable risks → YES (differentiation risk addressed with positioning)
- [x] Feasibility score >6/10 → YES (7.5)
- [x] Success patterns identified → YES (Plausible, Fathom, Beehiiv analyzed)
- [x] Clear differentiation exists → YES (privacy-first + React integration)
- [x] Monetization path validated → YES ($9/mo SaaS, proven model)
- [x] You're excited to build this → YES (personal pain point)

**DECISION: GO ✅**
**Action:** Proceed with 6-month timeline, build MVP, launch on Product Hunt

### Example 2: ITERATE ⚠️ - AI-Powered Recipe Generator

**Scores:**
- Final Score: 5.8/10
- Idea: 48/80 (60%)
- Success Patterns: 5/10 (few AI food apps succeeded)
- Feasibility: 6/10

**Decision Checklist:**
- [ ] Final score >6.5/10 → NO (5.8, but close)
- [x] No critical unmitigable risks → Uncertain (AI costs unknown)
- [x] Feasibility score >6/10 → YES (6.0, barely)
- [ ] Success patterns identified → Partial (no clear AI food success)
- [ ] Clear differentiation exists → Weak (many AI recipe apps)
- [x] Monetization path validated → Maybe ($4.99/mo but untested)
- [x] You're excited to build this → YES (love cooking)

**DECISION: ITERATE ⚠️**
**Action:**
- Spend 30 days validating demand (landing page + 100 signups)
- Test AI costs with small prototype
- Research 5 more competitors deeply
- Re-assess with new data

### Example 3: NO-GO ❌ - Enterprise CRM for Large Companies

**Scores:**
- Final Score: 3.2/10
- Idea: 32/80 (40%)
- Success Patterns: 2/10 (no solo founder CRM success)
- Feasibility: 3/10

**Decision Checklist:**
- [ ] Final score >6.5/10 → NO (3.2, far below)
- [ ] No critical unmitigable risks → NO (need sales team, 2+ years runway)
- [ ] Feasibility score >6/10 → NO (3.0, critical)
- [ ] Success patterns identified → NO (all successful CRMs had teams + funding)
- [ ] Clear differentiation exists → NO (Salesforce, HubSpot dominate)
- [ ] Monetization path validated → NO (long sales cycles, need demos)
- [x] You're excited to build this → Maybe (but not realistic)

**DECISION: NO-GO ❌**
**Action:**
- Pivot to "CRM for solo consultants" (smaller scope)
- OR abandon and use idea-finder for new opportunities
- Document learnings for future reference
