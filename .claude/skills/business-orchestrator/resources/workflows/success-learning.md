# Success Learning Workflow

Workflow for learning from successful products and applying to your idea.

## Overview

**Use Case:** "Analyze how [Product X] succeeded and apply to my idea"

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Deep Success Analysis (success-formula-analyzer)

**Input:** Successful product/founder to analyze
**Actions:**
- Research founder journey
- Extract success formula
- Identify reproducible patterns
- Document key decisions

**Output:** Success formula template

**Example: Analyzing Plausible Analytics Success**
```
Success Formula Extracted:
1. Privacy-first positioning (GDPR-friendly)
2. Open source → trust + community
3. Simple pricing ($9/mo flat)
4. Transparent building-in-public
5. Indie Hackers + HN distribution
6. Solo founder → low overhead

Key Metrics:
- $4M ARR (2024)
- 10K+ customers
- 2 co-founders
- Bootstrapped
```

### Step 2: Apply to Your Idea (business-idea-evaluator)

**Input:** Your idea + success formula

**Example: Your Idea = "Screen recording tool for developers"**
```
Mapping Plausible's Formula:
✅ Privacy-first → "Local recording, no cloud storage"
✅ Open source → Release core as open source
✅ Simple pricing → $9/mo, single tier
✅ Build-in-public → Tweet progress weekly
✅ IH + HN distribution → Perfect audience fit
⚠️ Solo founder → You have full-time job (20h/week max)

Alignment Score: 8/10
Gap: Time availability (vs Plausible's full-time founders)
```

### Step 3: Validate Replicability (feasibility-checker)

**Example: Can you replicate their tactics?**
```
Tactic Check:
1. Privacy-first tech: ✅ (use local storage APIs)
2. Open source core: ✅ (GitHub, MIT license)
3. Simple pricing: ✅ (Stripe, $9/mo)
4. Build-in-public: ✅ (you have 500 Twitter followers)
5. IH + HN launch: ✅ (active member)
6. Solo execution: ⚠️ (6 months part-time vs 12 months full-time)

Feasibility: 7/10 (doable with scope cuts)
```

### Step 4: Adaptation Plan

**Example: Your Adapted Strategy**
```
COPY from Plausible:
- Privacy-first messaging
- Open source core
- $9/mo pricing
- IH + HN launch

ADAPT for your context:
- MVP in 6 months (vs 12) → Cut 50% features
- Part-time (vs full-time) → No complex admin panel
- Developers (vs marketing) → Different messaging

DO DIFFERENTLY:
- Target: VS Code extension (easier distribution)
- Focus: Code walkthrough recordings (niche)
- Launch: Show HN with open source repo first
```
