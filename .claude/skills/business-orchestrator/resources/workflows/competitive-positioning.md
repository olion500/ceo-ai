# Competitive Positioning Workflow

Workflow for positioning against existing competitors.

## Overview

**Use Case:** "Help me position against existing competitors"

## Complete Example: Email Editor for Developers

### Step 1: Market Landscape (business-idea-evaluator)

**Input:** "Email template builder for developer teams"

**Competitive Analysis:**
```
Established Players:
1. Mailchimp ($800M+ rev) - Enterprise, complex, expensive
2. SendGrid ($3B acquired) - Transactional focus, technical
3. Customer.io ($150M rev) - Automation-heavy, expensive
4. Resend ($20M ARR) - Developer-first, simple API

Market Gaps Identified:
❌ No simple email builder for devs who want design + code
❌ All tools require design skills OR coding skills
❌ React component support missing
❌ Git workflow integration missing
```

**Output:** Opportunity in "developer experience + visual design" gap

### Step 2: Success Pattern Benchmarking (success-formula-analyzer)

**How did late entrants win in similar markets?**
```
Case 1: Notion (vs Evernote, OneNote)
- Better UX + databases = won design-savvy users
- Positioning: "All-in-one workspace"

Case 2: Vercel (vs Netlify, Heroku)
- Developer experience focus
- Positioning: "Frontend Cloud"

Case 3: Linear (vs Jira, Asana)
- Fast, beautiful, keyboard shortcuts
- Positioning: "Built for high-performance teams"

Winning Pattern:
✅ Target specific persona (not "everyone")
✅ 10x better on ONE dimension (UX, DX, speed)
✅ Community-driven early adoption
```

### Step 3: Capability Assessment (feasibility-checker)

**Can you execute differentiation strategies?**
```
Strategy 1: React component library for emails
- Technical feasibility: 8/10 (you know React)
- Time: 3 months for MVP
- Sustainable: ✅ (hard to copy quickly)

Strategy 2: Git-based workflow
- Technical feasibility: 6/10 (need to learn Git APIs)
- Time: 4 months
- Sustainable: ✅ (unique positioning)

Strategy 3: AI email generation
- Technical feasibility: 4/10 (complex)
- Time: 6+ months
- Sustainable: ⚠️ (everyone doing AI)

Recommended: Strategy 1 (React components) + Strategy 2 (Git)
```

### Step 4: Final Positioning Strategy

**Positioning Statement:**
```
"Email builder for React developers who want beautiful emails without leaving their codebase"
```

**Differentiation Tactics:**
```
PRIMARY (10x better):
- React components → emails (copy-paste code)
- Git integration (version control, review, deploy)
- TypeScript support

SECONDARY:
- Developer-first pricing ($19/mo vs $299/mo)
- Open source core components
- CLI tool for local development
```

**Market Entry Strategy:**
```
Phase 1: Community Building
- Launch open source React email components
- Post on Show HN, /r/reactjs
- Target: 1K GitHub stars

Phase 2: Beta Launch
- Invite React devs from OSS project
- $19/mo early bird pricing
- Target: 50 paying teams

Phase 3: Distribution
- Integrate with Next.js, Remix docs
- Partner with Vercel, Netlify
- Target: $5K MRR in 6 months
```

**Messaging Examples:**
```
Homepage: "Turn React components into beautiful emails"
Twitter: "Stop fighting with Mailchimp's drag-and-drop. Write emails in React, version control in Git, deploy like code."
IH: "Built email builder for devs. React → Email in 5 min. $1K MRR in Month 2."
```
