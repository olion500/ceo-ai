# Time Feasibility Assessment

Detailed guide for evaluating timeline and opportunity cost.

## Overview

Assess if you can complete this project in a reasonable timeframe with available time.

## Timeline Estimation

### MVP Scope Definition
- Core features (must-have)
- Nice-to-have features (later)
- Clear MVP boundaries

### Time Estimation Formula

**Base Formula:**
```
Actual Time = (Estimated Time) × (Complexity Multiplier) × (Buffer Factor)

Where:
- Complexity Multiplier: 1x (familiar tech), 1.5x (some learning), 2x+ (lots of learning)
- Buffer Factor: 1.5x (experienced), 2x (intermediate), 3x (beginner)
```

**Real Example: Building a SaaS Dashboard**

| Phase | Base Estimate | Complexity (1.5x) | Buffer (2x) | Actual Time |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Planning | 1 week | → 1.5 weeks | → 3 weeks | **3 weeks** |
| Auth setup | 2 days | → 3 days | → 6 days | **~1 week** |
| Dashboard UI | 2 weeks | → 3 weeks | → 6 weeks | **6 weeks** |
| API backend | 2 weeks | → 3 weeks | → 6 weeks | **6 weeks** |
| Integrations | 1 week | → 1.5 weeks | → 3 weeks | **3 weeks** |
| Testing | 1 week | → 1.5 weeks | → 3 weeks | **3 weeks** |
| **TOTAL** | **8 weeks** | **12 weeks** | **24 weeks** | **~6 months** |

**Key Insight:** Your "8 week" estimate becomes 6 months in reality.

## Availability Assessment

### Time Inventory

**Example Calculation:**
```
Available time per week:
- Weekend: 8 hours (Sat) + 6 hours (Sun) = 14 hours
- Weeknights: 2 hours × 3 nights = 6 hours
- TOTAL: 20 hours/week theoretical maximum

Realistic sustainable: 20 × 0.7 = 14 hours/week
(Account for fatigue, life, burnout prevention)
```

### Realistic Capacity

**Effective Time Formula:**
```
Effective Coding Hours = Total Hours × 0.6

Where 40% goes to:
- Research/learning (15%)
- Debugging (10%)
- Meetings/planning (5%)
- Breaks/context switching (10%)
```

**Example:**
```
Available: 14 hours/week
Effective coding: 14 × 0.6 = ~8-9 hours/week
Per month: ~35-40 hours of actual coding

If MVP = 200 hours of work:
Timeline: 200 ÷ 8.5 = ~24 weeks (6 months)
```

## Opportunity Cost Analysis

### Opportunity Cost Calculation Worksheet

**Scenario: 6 months to build SaaS MVP (14 hours/week)**

| Option | Time Investment | Financial Outcome | Non-Financial Value | Total Value |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Freelancing** | 336 hours (14h×24w) | $16,800 (@ $50/hr) | Low learning, stable | $16,800 |
| **Side Project (This)** | 336 hours | $0-500/mo (uncertain) | High learning, ownership | $0-12,000 |
| **Learning** | 336 hours | $0 now, +$20K salary later | Career growth | ~$20,000 (future) |
| **Do Nothing** | 336 hours saved | $0 | Rest, relationships | Priceless? |

**Calculation Example:**
```
Freelance Opportunity Cost:
- Your rate: $50/hour
- Time: 14 hours/week × 24 weeks = 336 hours
- Lost income: 336 × $50 = $16,800

Your project must generate:
- Minimum $3K/month to match freelancing after 6 months
- OR provide >$16K in learning/equity value
```

**Break-Even Analysis:**
```
If project succeeds:
- Month 1-6: -$16,800 (opportunity cost)
- Month 7+: +$3,000/month revenue
- Break-even: Month 12 (recoup lost freelance income)
- 2-year value: $54,000 - $16,800 = +$37,200

If project fails (50% chance):
- Expected value: ($37,200 × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) = $18,600
- vs Freelancing guaranteed: $16,800
- Risk-adjusted decision: PROCEED (if >50% confidence)
```

## Milestone Planning

Set aggressive but realistic milestones:
- Week 2: [Deliverable]
- Week 4: [Deliverable]
- Week 8: [MVP complete]

**Decision points:**
- If behind schedule by X%, reassess
- If blocked for Y days, get help
- Set hard deadline for go/no-go

## Motivation & Burnout Prevention

- Set sustainable pace (not sprint)
- Build in public for accountability
- Find co-founder or accountability partner
- Define small wins to celebrate
