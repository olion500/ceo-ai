# Resource Enrichment TODO

**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Status:** Planning → In Progress
**Goal:** Enrich placeholder resource files with practical, concise content

---

## Principles

- ✅ **Concise:** No fluff, only actionable content
- ✅ **Non-redundant:** Don't repeat what's in SKILL.md
- ✅ **Practical:** Focus on how-to, examples, templates
- ❌ **No bloat:** Avoid lengthy explanations already covered elsewhere
