## Common Evaluation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Overweighting Personal Passion
**Problem:** "I love this idea" bias clouds objective assessment
**Fix:** Separate personal interest from market validation
**Question:** Would this score well if someone else pitched it?

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Competition
**Problem:** "I haven't seen competitors" = "No market"
**Fix:** Research thoroughly, competition often indicates demand
**Question:** Why hasn't this been solved if it's a real problem?

### Mistake 3: Overestimating Market Size
**Problem:** Using TAM instead of realistic SAM/SOM
**Fix:** Calculate what YOU can actually reach in Year 1-2
**Question:** How many customers can I realistically acquire?

### Mistake 4: Underestimating Time to Market
**Problem:** "Just 3 months" turns into 9 months
**Fix:** Add 2-3x buffer for unknowns
**Question:** What could go wrong that I haven't anticipated?

### Mistake 5: Assuming "Build it and they will come"
**Problem:** Great product, no distribution plan
**Fix:** Evaluate distribution difficulty explicitly
**Question:** How will customer #1, #10, #100 find me?
