# Scratch Your Own Itch Method

**Success Rate: 79%** - Highest among all methods

## Overview

Build a solution to your own recurring problem. This method has the highest success rate because:
- Deep problem understanding (you live it daily)
- Built-in beta tester (yourself)
- Authentic positioning ("made by X for Xs")
- Clear validation (if it solves your problem)

## How It Works

### Step 1: Identify Personal Pain Points

Ask yourself:
1. "What repetitive tasks frustrate me daily?"
2. "What tools do I use but hate?"
3. "What problems do I solve manually that should be automated?"
4. "What did I wish existed in my last project?"

### Step 2: Validation Process (DO THIS BEFORE BUILDING)

**Week 1: Online Validation**
```
Day 1-2: Search for complaints
- Reddit: Search "[your problem]" in relevant subreddits
- Twitter: Search "[problem] frustrated" OR "[problem] annoying"
- Forums: Check Stack Overflow, Indie Hackers, HN

Target: Find 20+ people complaining about same problem

Day 3-4: Competitor research
- Search "[problem] solution" OR "[problem] tool"
- If 3-5 competitors exist → GOOD SIGN (proven market)
- If 0 competitors → RED FLAG (might be niche/no money)
- If 10+ competitors → Check if all are enterprise/expensive

Day 5-7: Landing page test
- Build simple landing page explaining your solution
- Post on Twitter, Reddit, IH
- Target: 50+ email signups in 1 week
- If <20 signups → weak validation, reconsider
```

**Week 2: Interview Validation**
```
- DM 20 people who face this problem
- Book 10 customer interviews (30min each)
- Ask: "How do you solve this today? Would you pay $X/mo for automated solution?"
- Target: 3+ "Yes, I'd pay" responses

If <3 willing to pay → De-scope or pivot
If 3-5 willing to pay → PROCEED with MVP
If 5+ willing to pay → Strong validation, GO
```

### Step 3: Build Solution You Wish Existed

- Start with minimal solution for YOUR use case
- Use it yourself for 2-4 weeks
- Refine based on your own feedback
- Then share with others

## Evaluation Criteria

✅ **Good "Scratch Your Own Itch" Idea If:**
- Problem occurs daily/weekly (not one-time)
- Pain is strong (very frustrating, not mildly annoying)
- Others likely have same problem (validated)
- Current solutions are inadequate
- You can build it with your skills

❌ **Red Flags:**
- Hypothetical problem ("I wish I exercised more")
- Only you have this problem
- Problem doesn't exist in daily reality
- Requires massive resources you don't have

## Detailed Success Examples

### Example 1: TypingMind ($83K MRR)

**Problem:** Tony used ChatGPT daily but hated the UI (no folders, slow, no shortcuts)

**Validation:**
- Searched Twitter: 1000+ tweets complaining about ChatGPT UI
- Built landing page in 2 days → 500 signups in Week 1
- Interviewed 10 power users → all said "I'd pay $10/mo"

**Build:** MVP in 3 weeks (just better UI wrapper)

**Launch:** Product Hunt → #1 of the day

**Outcome:**
- Month 1: $2K MRR (200 users)
- Month 6: $15K MRR (1,500 users)
- Month 12: $50K MRR (5,000 users)
- Today: $83K MRR

**Key Success Factor:** Solved his own daily pain point, others had same pain

### Example 2: ShipFast ($50K MRR)

**Problem:** Marc Lou kept rebuilding same boilerplate (auth, payments, email) for each new project

**Validation:**
- Searched /r/SideProject: 100+ "anyone have boilerplate?" posts
- Tweeted idea → 200 likes, 30 DMs asking "when ready?"
- Pre-sold 10 licenses at $99 before building

**Build:** MVP in 2 weeks (Next.js starter with auth/payments)

**Launch:** Twitter + Indie Hackers

**Outcome:**
- Week 1: $5K revenue (50 licenses sold)
- Month 1: $12K revenue (120 licenses)
- Month 6: $30K MRR (recurring + one-time)
- Today: $50K MRR

**Key Success Factor:** Built exactly what he needed, developers have same need

### Example 3: Bank Statement Converter ($16K MRR)

**Problem:** Angus manually converted bank PDFs to CSV for accounting every month (2 hours)

**Build:** MVP in 3 weeks (PDF parser + CSV export)

**Launch:** Show HN → front page

**Outcome:**
- Month 1: $800 MRR (80 users @ $10/mo)
- Month 3: $4K MRR (400 users)
- Month 12: $12K MRR (1,200 users)
- Today: $16K MRR

**Key Success Factor:** Boring but valuable problem, recurring monthly need
