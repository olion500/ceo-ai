# Example Business Ideas (Using Success Patterns)

## Idea: Cursor Settings Sync

**One-Liner**: Sync Cursor IDE settings and AI rules across machines and teams

**Success Pattern**: Scratch Your Own Itch (Developer Tools)
- Similar to ShipFast (developer tool solving repetitive problem)
- Similar to DevUtils (developer productivity)

**The Problem**:
Developers using Cursor IDE manually copy/paste `.cursorrules`, settings, and AI configurations across machines. Teams struggle to share best practices for AI-assisted coding. Every new machine setup takes 30+ minutes.

**Target Customer**:
- Who: Developers using Cursor IDE daily (100K+ users)
- Where: Cursor Discord, r/cursor, Twitter #CursorIDE
- Size: 100K+ Cursor users, growing rapidly (AI coding assistants trend)

**Validation Signals**:
- Cursor Discord: 50+ posts asking "how to sync settings?"
- Reddit r/cursor: Multiple threads about sharing AI rules
- Twitter: Developers manually maintaining settings repos
- Personal pain: I have 3 machines, hate manual sync

**MVP Scope (3 days)**:
- Core Feature 1: Cloud storage for .cursorrules file
- Core Feature 2: One-command sync (`cursor-sync pull/push`)
- Core Feature 3: Team sharing (share URL with team)
- Strip: Version control, collaboration, fancy UI (add later)

**Monetization**:
- Model: One-time purchase (like TypingMind)
- Price Point: $19 one-time OR $5/month for teams
- Why It Works: Developers pay for time-savers (ShipFast $4K/day proves this)

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Primary: Cursor Discord + Reddit + Show HN
- Secondary: Build in public on Twitter
- Timeline: 0-3 months (immediate community targeting)

**Similar Success Stories**:
- ShipFast: Developer boilerplate → $50K MRR
- TypingMind: Better ChatGPT UI → $83K MRR
- DevUtils: Developer utilities → $5K/month

**Score**: 8.3/10
- Personal Pain: 9/10 (I need this daily)
- Market Size: 7/10 (100K+ Cursor users, niche but growing)
- Achievability: 10/10 (can build in 3 days with CLI + cloud storage)
- Monetization: 8/10 (clear value, developers pay)
- Competition: 9/10 (no direct competitor exists)
- Timing: 9/10 (Cursor growing fast, AI coding hot)

**Recommendation**: GO - Start building this weekend

**Next Steps**:
1. Post in Cursor Discord: "Would you pay $19 for instant settings sync?"
2. Build MVP in 3 days: CLI + simple cloud storage
3. Launch on Show HN + Cursor communities

## Idea: Notion to Markdown Exporter (with AI Cleanup)

**One-Liner**: Export Notion databases to clean Markdown with AI-powered formatting cleanup

**Success Pattern**: Scratch Your Own Itch + AI Enhancement
- Similar to Bank Statement Converter (format conversion)
- Similar to TypingMind (AI enhancement of existing tool)

**The Problem**:
Notion's markdown export is broken (weird formatting, broken tables, lost metadata). Developers migrating to Obsidian/static sites spend hours manually cleaning exported markdown. No good tool exists.

**Target Customer**:
- Who: Developers migrating from Notion to Obsidian/static sites
- Where: r/ObsidianMD, r/Notion, Obsidian forums, PKM communities
- Size: 100K+ Notion power users, growing "local-first" movement

**Validation Signals**:
- Reddit r/ObsidianMD: 200+ upvotes "Notion migration is painful"
- Obsidian forum: Stickied thread about Notion import issues
- Twitter: Weekly complaints about broken Notion export
- Personal: Spent 6 hours cleaning my own Notion export

**MVP Scope (5 days)**:
- Core Feature 1: Notion API integration (read databases)
- Core Feature 2: Clean markdown conversion (fix tables, links)
- Core Feature 3: AI cleanup pass (Claude API for formatting)
- Strip: Batch processing, custom templates (add later)

**Monetization**:
- Model: One-time purchase per export OR subscription
- Price Point: $29 one-time per database OR $9/month unlimited
- Why It Works: One-time migration = one-time payment makes sense

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Primary: r/ObsidianMD, r/Notion, PKM communities
- Secondary: SEO for "notion to markdown converter"
- Timeline: 0-6 months (community + SEO)

**Similar Success Stories**:
- Bank Statement Converter: PDF conversion → $16K MRR
- TypingMind: AI enhancement → $83K MRR

**Score**: 7.8/10
- Personal Pain: 9/10 (I painfully did this manually)
- Market Size: 7/10 (niche but active PKM community)
- Achievability: 7/10 (5 days, Notion API + Claude API)
- Monetization: 8/10 (clear value, people pay for migration tools)
- Competition: 8/10 (existing tools are bad)
- Timing: 7/10 (local-first movement growing)

**Recommendation**: VALIDATE MORE - Talk to 10 people first

**Next Steps**:
1. Post in r/ObsidianMD: "Would you pay $29 for perfect Notion export?"
2. Ask 10 people who migrated: What did they pay/do?
3. If 5+ say yes → build MVP in 5 days

## Idea: GitHub Action Marketplace Boilerplate

**One-Liner**: ShipFast for GitHub Actions - ship custom actions in minutes, not hours

**Success Pattern**: Scratch Your Own Itch (Boilerplate) + Data-Driven
- Directly inspired by ShipFast's success
- Apply to GitHub Actions (growing market)

**The Problem**:
Creating GitHub Actions requires repetitive boilerplate (TypeScript setup, testing, publishing, versioning). Every new action = 2 hours of setup before writing actual logic. No good template exists.

**Target Customer**:
- Who: Developers creating custom GitHub Actions
- Where: GitHub discussions, r/github, DevOps communities
- Size: 50M+ GitHub developers, 10K+ publishing actions

**Validation Signals**:
- GitHub: 5K+ repos with "action-template" (people searching)
- Twitter: Complaints about GitHub Action setup complexity
- Personal: Created 3 actions, hated setup every time

**MVP Scope (7 days)**:
- Core Feature 1: TypeScript action boilerplate
- Core Feature 2: Testing setup (Jest + act)
- Core Feature 3: One-command publish script
- Core Feature 4: Versioning automation
- Strip: Fancy docs, multiple languages (add later)

**Monetization**:
- Model: One-time purchase (exactly like ShipFast)
- Price Point: $49 one-time
- Why It Works: ShipFast proves developers pay for time-saving boilerplates

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Primary: Product Hunt + Show HN
- Secondary: GitHub Actions Marketplace (meta: action to create actions)
- Timeline: 0-3 months (launch-focused)

**Similar Success Stories**:
- ShipFast: Next.js boilerplate → $50K MRR, $1.2M lifetime
- (Exactly the same pattern, different target)

**Score**: 7.5/10
- Personal Pain: 8/10 (I've felt this pain)
- Market Size: 7/10 (smaller than web dev, but active)
- Achievability: 8/10 (can do in 7 days)
- Monetization: 9/10 (ShipFast proves model works)
- Competition: 7/10 (free templates exist, but not comprehensive)
- Timing: 6/10 (not trending, but steady need)

**Recommendation**: VALIDATE MORE - Check if people will pay vs use free

**Next Steps**:
1. Ask in r/github: "Would you pay $49 for comprehensive Action boilerplate?"
2. Check ShipFast Discord: Has anyone requested this?
3. Build free version first, upgrade path to paid

## Idea: "Email to Calendar" AI Parser

**One-Liner**: Forward any email to ai@yourcalendar.app, AI extracts event details and adds to calendar

**Success Pattern**: Scratch Your Own Itch + AI Enhancement
- Similar to TypingMind (AI improving existing workflow)

**The Problem**:
People manually copy event details from emails to calendar (meeting invites without .ics, casual "let's meet next Tuesday" emails). Takes 30 seconds per email, happens 5-10x daily. No good solution for natural language email parsing.

**Target Customer**:
- Who: Busy professionals, founders, anyone with 20+ meetings/week
- Where: r/productivity, Indie Hackers, HN
- Size: 10M+ professionals with busy calendars

**Validation Signals**:
- r/productivity: "I waste 10 minutes daily on calendar entry"
- Personal: I do this 5x daily, hate it
- Competitors: Motion.ai ($10M+ funding) does this as part of bigger product

**MVP Scope (5 days)**:
- Core Feature 1: Email forwarding endpoint (unique address per user)
- Core Feature 2: AI parsing (Claude API to extract date/time/title)
- Core Feature 3: Google Calendar API integration (add event)
- Strip: Slack/Teams integration, advanced parsing (add later)

**Monetization**:
- Model: Subscription (ongoing AI API costs)
- Price Point: $5/month (like Superhuman's pricing tier)
- Why It Works: Time-saving, ongoing value, people pay for calendar tools

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Primary: r/productivity, Indie Hackers
- Secondary: Build in public on Twitter
- Timeline: 0-6 months (community + content)

**Similar Success Stories**:
- TypingMind: AI enhancement → $83K MRR
- Motion.ai: Calendar AI (but $34/mo, way overpriced)

**Score**: 7.2/10
- Personal Pain: 9/10 (daily frustration)
- Market Size: 8/10 (huge market of busy professionals)
- Achievability: 7/10 (5 days, email + AI + calendar API)
- Monetization: 7/10 (ongoing costs, need subscription)
- Competition: 6/10 (Motion.ai exists but expensive)
- Timing: 7/10 (AI productivity tools trending)

**Recommendation**: VALIDATE MORE - Pricing is tricky vs Motion

**Next Steps**:
1. Ask 20 people: "Would you pay $5/mo for this?"
2. Check Motion.ai users: Do they complain about price?
3. Build free version (10 emails/mo), paid for unlimited

## Idea: "Indie Hacker Tax Optimizer"

**One-Liner**: AI tax advisor for indie hackers - track expenses, optimize deductions, generate reports

**Success Pattern**: Niche Community Tool + AI Enhancement
- Similar to Nomad List (serve specific community intensely)
- Similar to Bank Statement Converter (financial automation)

**The Problem**:
Indie hackers don't know what's tax-deductible (travel? meals? software?). Miss thousands in deductions. Generic tools (TurboTax) don't understand SaaS business model. Accountants expensive ($200+/hr).

**Target Customer**:
- Who: Indie hackers making $20K-$200K/year
- Where: Indie Hackers, r/SideProject, Twitter #buildinpublic
- Size: 50K+ indie hackers (growing rapidly)

**Validation Signals**:
- Indie Hackers: Weekly posts "What can I deduct?"
- Twitter: Founders confused about taxes
- Personal: I overpay taxes, don't know what's legal

**MVP Scope (7 days)**:
- Core Feature 1: Expense categorizer (upload receipts)
- Core Feature 2: AI deduction advisor (Claude: "Is this deductible?")
- Core Feature 3: Export for accountant (CSV/PDF)
- Strip: Filing integration, multi-country (add later)

**Monetization**:
- Model: Subscription OR one-time per tax year
- Price Point: $99/year OR $199 one-time per year
- Why It Works: Saves $1,000+ in taxes, easy ROI

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Primary: Indie Hackers community posts
- Secondary: Build in public on Twitter
- Timeline: 0-12 months (launch in Jan before tax season)

**Similar Success Stories**:
- Nomad List: Niche community tool → $1.5M ARR
- FlyFin (competitor): AI tax app → $10M+ funding

**Score**: 6.8/10
- Personal Pain: 8/10 (I need this)
- Market Size: 6/10 (niche but high-value)
- Achievability: 6/10 (7 days MVP, tax rules complex)
- Monetization: 8/10 (clear ROI, high willingness to pay)
- Competition: 7/10 (FlyFin exists but general, not indie-specific)
- Timing: 7/10 (always relevant, seasonal boost)

**Recommendation**: VALIDATE MORE - Legal/compliance risk high

**Next Steps**:
1. Ask CPA: Legal to give tax advice with AI?
2. Post in IH: "Would you pay $99/year for indie tax optimizer?"
3. Partner with CPA for compliance review
