## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
**Who:** Solo developers, small teams without senior developers
**What:** No one to review code quality, logic, best practices
**Current Pain:**
- Solo developers = no code review
- Hiring senior dev = $100K+ salary
- ESLint/Prettier = style only, not logic
- ChatGPT = manual copy-paste, no automation

**Why It Hurts:**
- Code quality suffers without reviews
- Bugs slip through
- Technical debt accumulates
- Can't afford senior developer

### The Solution
GitHub App that triggers on PR creation → Claude API analyzes code → Posts inline comments with improvement suggestions

**Core Value Proposition:**
Help solo developers and small teams get senior-level code reviews automatically for $29/month instead of hiring a $100K+ senior developer.
