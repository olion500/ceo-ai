# Dev Skills Practice Platform - Business Idea

## Core Idea

**"LeetCode for Real Developer Skills"** - An interactive practice platform where developers can test and improve their proficiency in practical tools and technologies (DevOps, Git, Linux, etc.) rather than just algorithms.

### The Concept

A hands-on learning platform similar to LeetCode's problem-solving approach, but focused on **실무 기술 (practical/real-world skills)** that developers actually use in their daily work:

- **Not:** Algorithm puzzles, data structures challenges
- **Instead:** Docker container challenges, Kubernetes configuration tasks, Git workflows, Linux system administration, CI/CD pipeline building

### What Makes It Different from Existing Platforms

#### vs LeetCode/HackerRank
- **They focus on:** Coding interview prep, algorithms, data structures
- **We focus on:** DevOps, infrastructure, tools, real-world scenarios

#### vs KodeKloud
- **They focus on:** Certification prep, comprehensive courses, video lectures
- **We focus on:** Quick skill assessment, bite-sized challenges, level-based progression

#### vs Exercism
- **They focus on:** Programming languages, code mentoring, general coding practice
- **We focus on:** Infrastructure tools, DevOps practices, modern development workflows

- **Similar to:** KodeKloud's labs (they succeeded)
- **Mitigation:** Start with simpler terminal-based challenges, partner with infrastructure providers

### 2. Content Creation Workload
- **Challenge:** Creating 100+ quality challenges takes significant time
- **Similar to:** LeetCode/Exercism built incrementally
- **Mitigation:** Start with 3 skill areas, community contributions, AI-assisted generation

### 3. Competition from Free Resources
- **Challenge:** Lots of free tutorials and docs exist
- **Counter:** Structured progression, assessment, certification, gamification add value
- **Evidence:** LeetCode/KodeKloud charge despite free alternatives

### 4. Market Saturation
- **Challenge:** EdTech is crowded
- **Counter:** No one combines practice-based approach with infrastructure skills
- **Evidence:** KodeKloud ($15M ARR) and LeetCode ($33M+) both succeed in adjacent spaces

### 5. B2B Sales Complexity
- **Challenge:** Selling to enterprises is different skillset
- **Mitigation:** Start B2C, add B2B later (like LeetCode/HackerRank did)
