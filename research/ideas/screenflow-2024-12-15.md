## Quick Summary

**One-Liner:** Record your screen → AI automatically generates step-by-step tutorial documentation with screenshots

**Success Pattern Applied:**
- Scratch Your Own Itch (80%)
- AI Enhancement (Hot)
- Unbundling Manual Work (High)
- Premium Pricing (High)

**Expected Timeline:**
- MVP: 14-21 days (more complex)
- First Revenue: 4-8 weeks
- $1K MRR: 6-12 months

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
**Who:** SaaS founders, product managers, technical writers
**What:** Creating tutorial docs takes hours (record → screenshot → write steps)
**Current Pain:**
- Screen record → extract frames → write descriptions = 2-4 hours per tutorial
- Loom gives video, not documentation
- Manual updates when UI changes

**Why It Hurts:**
- Time-consuming (2-4 hours per tutorial)
- Boring, repetitive work
- Docs get outdated quickly

### The Solution
Electron app records screen → Claude Vision API analyzes frames → Generates Markdown tutorial + screenshots

**Core Value Proposition:**
Help SaaS teams create tutorial documentation in 10 minutes instead of 2-4 hours using AI-powered screen analysis.
