## Common Patterns Identified

### 1. Rapid Prototyping Philosophy ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Universal across both stories**

**What It Is:**
"Just make whatever idea you have exist first, and then make it good later" - Ship imperfect v1, iterate based on real customer feedback

**CruiseCup Implementation:**
- Designed → Printed → Filmed → Posted same day
- Tested tactical reload holder with prototype video
- Viral video (50M+ views) validated before mass production
- Scaled to 130 printers based on proven demand

**ActivArmor Implementation:**
- Built prototypes for children in nonprofit program
- Tested with real patients immediately
- Iterated based on doctor feedback
- Evolved from manufacturing to software over 10 years

**Why It Works:**
- 3D printing enables days not months to market
- Test with real products, not assumptions
- Fail fast with minimal loss
- Data-driven scaling decisions

**Reproducibility:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Consumer 3D printers cost $100-200
- CAD software free (TinkerCAD, Fusion 360)
- Filament ~$20/roll
- Anyone can start small and scale

### 2. Niche Focus Over Broad Appeal ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Both dominated specific niches**

**CruiseCup/Solefully:**
- **Niche 1:** Crocs accessories exclusively (Solefully)
- **Niche 2:** Beverage can holders (CruiseCup)

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

### B2C Failures

1. **Giving up too early**
   - "Your first 100 videos might flop"
   - Viral moments come after months of consistency
   - Most quit before algorithm learns audience

2. **Chasing perfection over shipping**
   - "Just make it exist first, make it good later"
   - Overthinking prevents rapid iteration
   - Customer feedback > perfect design

3. **Ignoring community engagement**
   - Comments contain product ideas
   - Community feels invested when you respond
   - "Infinite ideas from audience"

4. **Expanding too broadly**
   - Niche focus first (Crocs accessories only)
   - Master one category before adding second brand
   - Clear positioning > general store

### B2B Failures

1. **Shotgun approach to market**
   - "Don't use shotgun approach"
   - Target early adopters, not mass market
   - ActivArmor: innovator physicians, not all doctors

2. **Neglecting regulatory compliance**
   - FDA collaboration early vs reactive compliance
   - Insider knowledge prevents years of mistakes
   - Compliance as competitive advantage

3. **Not evolving business model**
   - ActivArmor: Manufacturing → Software → Point-of-Care
   - Reduce capital intensity over time
   - Software licensing more scalable than physical production

4. **Expanding horizontally too soon**
   - Focus fractures before prosthetics/veterinary
   - Dominate $20B market before adjacent opportunities
   - Strategic focus prevents resource dilution
