## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Origin (2024):** **Nevo David** identified a 20-year-old market (social media scheduling) that lacked quality open-source solutions. Existing tools were expensive, closed-source, and often had vendor lock-in.

**Key Insight:** Developers and tech-savvy creators wanted:

- Open source alternative they could self-host
- No forced vendor payments (ability to self-host for free)
- Automation-friendly with good APIs
- Docker support for easy deployment

**Two Core Principles Established:**

1. Everything must be open-sourced
2. Charge only for cloud costs, never force developers to pay

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Development throughout 2024; launched September 2024

**Initial Features:**

- Social media post scheduling
- Multi-platform support
- Completely open source codebase
- Docker deployment support
- Public APIs for automation
- n8n integration (workflow automation)

**Tech Stack:**

- Mono-repo architecture
- Docker for deployment
- Public API
- n8n node for automation workflows
- Cloud-based deployment option

**Development Process:**

- Solo developer (Nevo David)
- Built entirely open source from day one
- Iterative feature releases (not big versions)
- Community-driven feature prioritization

**Development Costs:** Minimal—solo developer, no external funding

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Multi-platform (GitHub, Reddit, DEV, LinkedIn, X/Twitter)

**Date:** September 2024 (official launch)

**Pre-launch:**

- Built completely in public
- Shared progress on social media

**Launch Results:**

- **4.79M Docker downloads** achieved
- Immediate traction from developer community
- Strong open source community engagement

**Nevo's Philosophy:**
> "I didn't make big versions for Postiz. Every minor feature was a version."

Frequent, small updates maintained visibility across platforms instead of waiting for major releases.
