# Postiz Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Origin (2024):** **Nevo David** identified a 20-year-old market (social media scheduling) that lacked quality open-source solutions. Existing tools were expensive, closed-source, and often had vendor lock-in.

**Key Insight:** Developers and tech-savvy creators wanted:

- Open source alternative they could self-host
- No forced vendor payments (ability to self-host for free)
- Automation-friendly with good APIs
- Docker support for easy deployment

**Two Core Principles Established:**

1. Everything must be open-sourced
2. Charge only for cloud costs, never force developers to pay

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Development throughout 2024; launched September 2024

**Initial Features:**

- Social media post scheduling
- Multi-platform support
- Completely open source codebase
- Docker deployment support
- Public APIs for automation
- n8n integration (workflow automation)

**Tech Stack:**

- Mono-repo architecture
- Docker for deployment
- Public API
- n8n node for automation workflows
- Cloud-based deployment option

**Development Process:**

- Solo developer (Nevo David)
- Built entirely open source from day one
- Iterative feature releases (not big versions)
- Community-driven feature prioritization

**Development Costs:** Minimal—solo developer, no external funding

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Multi-platform (GitHub, Reddit, DEV, LinkedIn, X/Twitter)

**Date:** September 2024 (official launch)

**Pre-launch:**

- Built completely in public
- Shared progress on social media
- Listed on open source directories
- Docker support from early feedback

**Launch Process:**

**Launch Results:**

> "I didn't make big versions for Postiz. Every minor feature was a version."

Frequent, small updates maintained visibility across platforms instead of waiting for major releases.

### Growth Journey

### Key Decisions

1. **Open Source Everything (Day 1)**
   - **Why:** Fill gap in 20-year-old market lacking open source options
   - **Result:** Developer trust; community contributions; 4.79M Docker downloads

2. **Charge for Cloud, Not Features**
   - **Why:** "Never force developers to pay" for code
   - **Result:** Sustainable revenue ($14K MRR) while keeping free version fully functional

3. **Frequent Minor Releases vs Big Versions**
   - **Why:** Maintain visibility on Reddit, DEV, other platforms
   - **Result:** Consistent exposure; algorithm-friendly update cadence

4. **Docker Support from Community Feedback**

- Docker deployment
- Public API access
- Community support

**2. Cloud Hosting (Subscription):**

**Revenue Mix:**

- Subscriptions: Primary revenue source
- Affiliate marketing: Significant contributor
- All revenue from convenience/hosting, not features

**Growth Metrics:**

**Unit Economics:**

- Solo developer: Minimal fixed costs
- Cloud infrastructure: Variable costs
- Affiliate payouts: Performance-based
- High margins (solo operation)

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge: Mono-repo Complexity**
   - **Problem:** Difficult for users to deploy and use
   - **Solution:** Docker support made deployment one-command simple
   - **Result:** 4.79M Docker downloads; major adoption driver

2. **Challenge: Standing Out in Crowded Market**
   - **Problem:** Social media tools have existed for 20+ years
   - **Solution:** Open source differentiation; automation-first positioning
   - **Result:** Carved out niche with developers and automation users

3. **Challenge: Finding Right Audience**
   - **Problem:** Generic social media users not ideal fit
   - **Solution:** Pivoted to n8n users (automation developers)
   - **Result:** Revenue doubled in one month; product-market fit found

4. **Challenge: Sustaining Visibility**
   - **Problem:** How to stay visible without viral content
   - **Solution:** Frequent minor releases; every feature = new post
   - **Result:** Consistent presence on Reddit, DEV; algorithm-friendly

5. **Challenge: Severe Burnout**
   - **Problem:** One year of 200% intensity; newborn daughter; unsustainable pace
   - **Solution:** Building community to help each other (reduce founder burden)
