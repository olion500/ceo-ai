### Founder's Mindset & Decision-Making

**Initial Beliefs:**

  - Shifted to: Commercial business model can help more people and attract capital for scale

  - Shifted to: Software/design is core, manufacturing can be outsourced to FDA partners

  - Shifted to: iPhone app superior, free for providers, more scalable

  - Shifted to: Target early adopters, let innovation diffuse naturally

**Changed Beliefs:**

  - Financial success follows when you genuinely help people
  - "Every single day I'm successful because I get to help people"

  - Software licensing more scalable
  - Point-of-care leverages existing infrastructure

  - "Don't use a shotgun approach"
  - Master fracture care before prosthetics/veterinary

  - Flexibility more valuable than fixed expertise
  - Adjust team as business model evolves

  - COVID forced innovation that was better anyway
  - Free app vs expensive hardware distribution

**Critical Decisions Explained:**

1. **Decision: Invest life savings and live in poverty**
   - **Context:** Saw children with dirty casts, bed bugs, unable to wash hands
   - **Options Considered:**
     - Stay in six-figure job, volunteer time to nonprofit
     - Seek investors first before personal commitment
     - Full personal investment then seek capital
   - **Why Chose This:** Deep conviction that problem needed solving; skin in game demonstrates commitment
   - **Outcome:** Credibility with investors, sustained through difficult years, eventually raised $2M+

2. **Decision: Pivot from nonprofit to commercial medical device company**
   - **Context:** Doctors requesting product beyond mentoring program children
   - **Options Considered:**
     - Stay nonprofit, limited scale
     - Hybrid model (nonprofit + commercial arm)
     - Full commercial company
   - **Why Chose This:** Commercial model enables capital raising, faster scale, helps more people
   - **Outcome:** Access to $2M+ investment, 11-country expansion, thousands of patients

3. **Decision: Transition from manufacturing to software business model**
   - **Context:** In-house manufacturing capital-intensive, limiting scale
   - **Options Considered:**
     - Build larger manufacturing facility
     - Continue outsourced manufacturing
     - Shift to software licensing model
   - **Why Chose This:** Software more scalable, higher margins, lower capital requirements
   - **Outcome:** Point-of-care model, 400+ hospitals addressable, international expansion easier

4. **Decision: Develop iPhone app vs deploy 10,000 physical scanners**
   - **Context:** COVID prevented physical scanner placement in hospitals
   - **Options Considered:**
     - Wait out pandemic, deploy scanners later
     - Develop proprietary handheld scanner
     - Use commodity iPhone technology
   - **Why Chose This:** iPhone ubiquitous, app free for providers, more scalable
   - **Outcome:** Superior solution, eliminated hardware distribution, faster adoption

5. **Decision: Target early adopter physicians vs mass market**
   - **Context:** 400+ hospitals have 3D printing, culture change slow in medicine
   - **Options Considered:**
     - Broad physician education campaign
     - Target all orthopedists equally
     - Focus on innovators with 3D printing experience
   - **Why Chose This:** "Don't use a shotgun approach" - innovators adopt faster, become evangelists
   - **Outcome:** Market leader status, efficient sales, passionate advocates

6. **Decision: Focus exclusively on fracture care**
   - **Context:** Adjacent opportunities in prosthetics, veterinary, sports medicine
   - **Options Considered:**
     - Expand horizontally into multiple segments
     - Stay focused on fractures until dominated
     - Test multiple markets simultaneously
