# Simply Wall St Success Story

## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Al Bentley, a self-taught stock investor, had a painful experience when investing in stocks for the first time. His motivation was crystal clear:

> "The experience was just so bad I thought there surely must be a better way. It turns out there isn't. So I decided to build it."

**Key Insights:**
- Retail investors had access to democratized trading (e.g., Robinhood) but lacked the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions
- Professional-grade financial data was locked behind expensive institutional platforms
- Retail investors significantly underperformed markets due to insufficient financial literacy and decision-making discipline
- The investment industry was moving away from managed and advised services due to high fees and lack of trust

**Founder's Core Belief:**
> "We are giving investors access to high quality financial data used by institutions and professionals, at a fraction of a cost."

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Started as a weekend project in 2013 (from a startup weekend competition)

**Initial Product Name:** Ninjavest (later rebranded to Simply Wall St)

**Initial Approach:**
- Al built tools for himself first - tools that would turn complex financial data into something clear, visual, and easy to understand
- Focus on visualization of complex financial statements
- Make institutional-grade analysis accessible to retail investors

**Development Process:**
- Started building from personal pain point
- Iterated based on own needs first
- Gradually expanded to serve broader audience

**Tech Stack:**
- N/A (Information not available in sources)

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** N/A (Specific launch platform not mentioned in sources)
**Date:** 2013 (Initial launch as Ninjavest)

**Pre-launch:**

**Launch Results:**
- N/A (Specific launch metrics not available)

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Early Days (2013-2016)
- Started as Ninjavest from a weekend startup competition
- Built initial user base organically
- Focused on product development and feature expansion
- Remained bootstrapped during this period

#### Phase 2: Finding Traction (2016-2017)
- Explosive growth: 25,000 → ~100,000 users in one year
- Proved product-market fit
- Built reputation among retail investors
- Prepared for funding round

#### Phase 3: Customer-Funded Growth (2017)
- **June 2017:** Raised $1.8M-$3.4M (2.4M AUD) from existing customers
- Unconventional funding approach: High-net-worth customers became investors
- Expanded product to include investment advisory services
- Continued organic growth strategy

#### Phase 4: Mature Growth (2018-Present)
- Scaled to 3M+ users across 170 countries
- Grew team to 30+ members spanning US, Argentina, Ukraine, and UK
- Expanded from stock identification to comprehensive investment research platform
- Maintained position as affordable alternative to institutional platforms

### Key Decisions

1. **Build for Personal Use First**
   - **Why:** Al experienced the problem firsthand and understood exactly what was needed
   - **Result:** Created a product that genuinely solved real investor pain points

2. **Customer-Funded Instead of VC**
   - **Why:** Users who loved the product became investors, ensuring product-market fit
   - **Result:** Raised $1.8M in 6 weeks from satisfied customers, maintained control and alignment with user needs

3. **Democratize Institutional Data**
   - **Why:** Massive gap between what professionals and retail investors could access
   - **Result:** Positioned as the affordable alternative (fraction of institutional platform costs)

4. **Focus on Visual Financial Analysis**
   - **Why:** Traditional financial data was overwhelming and hard to understand
   - **Result:** Created the "snowflake" visualization system that made complex data accessible

### Pivots & Changes

- **Name Change:** Ninjavest → Simply Wall St (better branding, clearer positioning)
- **Product Evolution:** Stock identification tool → Comprehensive investment research platform with portfolio analysis and stock recommendations
- **Business Model:** Added investment advisory services (2017+)

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** Organic Growth
- Users discovering the platform through search and recommendations
- Focus on providing high-quality, free tools to build user base
- Grew from 25K to 100K users in one year through organic means

**Secondary Channels:**
- N/A (Specific channels not detailed in sources)

**Failed Attempts:**

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Freemium model with premium features

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Free tier: Basic stock analysis and visualization
- Premium tier: Advanced features, portfolio analysis, investment advisory services

**Pricing Evolution:**
- N/A (Specific pricing history not available in sources)

**Conversion Rate:** N/A (Not disclosed)

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Retail investors misusing the "snowflake" visualization as a stock-picking tool
   - **Solution:** Al publicly clarified: "The snowflake is fundamentally a stock identification system, not a stock-picking tool"
   - **Result:** Educated users on proper due diligence: "If something appears cheap, then you need to understand why. When you buy a stock you are 'betting against the market'"

2. **Challenge:** Competing with expensive institutional platforms
   - **Solution:** Position as the affordable alternative that "saves hours and hours of research time"
   - **Result:** Attracted 3M+ users who couldn't afford Bloomberg Terminal or similar tools

3. **Challenge:** Building trust in retail investing space
   - **Solution:** Focus on transparency, education, and empowering users to make informed decisions (not just recommendations)
   - **Result:** Built loyal customer base willing to invest in the company itself
