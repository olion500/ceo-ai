- Lesson: General stores lack focus and brand identity

**Second Store:**

- Details not disclosed
- Result: Failed
- Lesson: Multiple attempts required before success

**Key learnings:**

- Launched focused jewelry store (single-product niche)

#### Phase 3: Optimization & Scale (Months 6-14)

- Built brand reputation and trust
- Focused on repeat customers and referrals

**Results:**

- Achieved $2M milestone in just over a year

### Key Decisions

   - **Outcome:** Primary success product, $2M revenue

3. **Implementing 30-Minute Response Times (Store 3)**
   - **Why:** Customer service differentiation, trust-building

4. **Scaling Facebook Ads (Month 1+)**
