# Connected Papers Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Connected Papers was born from a personal pain point experienced by the three founders during their academic work.

**The Core Problem:**
- Writing literature reviews for thesis and research articles was their "nemesis"
- Finding quality content was a tiring, time-consuming task
- Existing tools didn't provide good visual overview of research landscapes
- Traditional citation tracking methods were linear and inefficient
- New papers without many citations were hard to discover using existing tools

**Key Insights:**
- Academic researchers need to see the **network of relationships** between papers, not just linear citation chains
- Visual representation helps identify influential papers, derivative works, and important connections
- The tool should work for both established papers (with many citations) AND new papers (with few citations)
- Starting in a new research field requires a bird's-eye view of the landscape

**What They Noticed:**
> The founders were facing issues while writing literature reviews for their thesis and research articles, having worked on academic papers for years with literature review remaining their nemesis because finding quality content was a tiring task.

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** ~6 months (2019 as side project, launched June 2020)

**Initial Features:**
- Visual graph showing papers similar to a seed paper
- Co-citation network analysis (papers cited together by other papers)
- Bibliographic coupling (papers sharing common references)
- Integration with Semantic Scholar's corpus
- Timeline visualization (papers arranged by publication date)
- Basic filtering and exploration tools

**Tech Stack:**
- Data Source: Semantic Scholar's corpus (used under ODC-BY license)
- Core Algorithm: Combination of co-citation + bibliographic coupling
- Frontend: Web-based visualization interface
- Backend: Graph analysis and similarity calculation engine

**Development Process:**
- Started as a weekend side project between three friends
- Built the tool initially for their own research needs
- Friends and colleagues kept asking to use it
- Realized the broader potential when others found it useful
- Decided to release publicly when demand became clear

**Critical Technical Decisions:**
1. **Using both co-citation AND bibliographic coupling**
   - Co-citation: Papers cited together by others (established papers)
   - Bibliographic coupling: Papers sharing references (works for new papers)
   - This dual approach solved the "new paper problem" that competitors faced

2. **Partnering with Semantic Scholar**
   - Free access to comprehensive academic database
   - Open license (ODC-BY) allowed commercial use
   - Avoided expensive licensing fees that plague competitors

3. **Visual-first approach**
   - Graph visualization as primary interface
   - Timeline arrangement for temporal context
   - Made complex citation networks immediately understandable

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Academic community, word-of-mouth, organic growth
**Date:** June 2020

**Pre-launch:**
- Built MVP while using it for their own research
- Beta testing with friends and colleagues
- Refined based on researcher feedback
- Ensured tool worked well for edge cases (new papers, niche fields)

**Launch Results:**
- Released as completely free tool initially
- Rapid organic adoption in academic community
- Word-of-mouth spread among researchers
- Featured in academic blogs and newsletters
- No traditional "launch day" marketing - soft launch approach

**Launch Philosophy:**
> "As this is built upon the back of data that I received for free, it feels like bad karma to charge for the service." - Early philosophy before monetization

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Early Days (2019-2020)

#### Phase 2: Public Release (June 2020)

#### Phase 3: Establishing Product-Market Fit (2020-2021)

#### Phase 4: Monetization (2021+)

### Key Decisions

1. **Bootstrap vs. Raise Funding**
   - **Why:** Wanted to maintain independence, build on their own terms
   - **Result:** Has not raised any funding yet, remains fully bootstrapped
   - **Trade-off:** Slower growth but complete control

2. **Freemium Model vs. Fully Free**
   - **Why:** Running backend servers was expensive (~$500/month scale)
   - **Result:** Sustainable business while keeping generous free tier
   - **Philosophy:** "Bad karma to charge" initially, but needed sustainability

3. **Focus on Academic vs. Expand to Other Domains**
   - **Why:** Deep expertise in academic research, clear pain point
   - **Result:** Became best-in-class for academic use case
   - **Benefit:** Avoided dilution, built strong reputation in niche

4. **Partner with Semantic Scholar vs. Build Own Database**
   - **Why:** Building comprehensive academic database would cost millions
   - **Result:** Leveraged existing data, focused on unique value (visualization + algorithm)
   - **Smart Move:** Let Semantic Scholar handle data maintenance

### Pivots & Changes

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "The founders were facing issues while writing literature reviews for their thesis and research articles... when the three friends realised how useful it was in their own research, and how their friends and colleagues kept on asking to use it, they decided to release the tool for the public."

**Key Success Factor: Building for themselves first**
- They were the target users
- Personal pain point ensured real problem-solution fit
- Organic demand from colleagues validated market need

### What They Say Didn't Work

No specific failures documented in available sources. The bootstrapped, organic approach appears to have worked well without major pivots or failures.

### Their Advice to Others

**On Monetization Philosophy:**
> "As this is built upon the back of data that I received for free, it feels like bad karma to charge for the service."

This reflects their initial thinking, though they later adopted freemium model when server costs required sustainability.

**Implied Lessons from Their Approach:**
- Build for yourself first (they were researchers solving their own problem)
- Let organic demand validate before big launch
- Bootstrap when possible to maintain control
- Leverage existing infrastructure (Semantic Scholar) rather than rebuilding everything
- Focus on one niche and become best-in-class

## Timeline Summary

```
2019:      Weekend project started by three friends
