## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Dylan Field's Background:**

- Brown University CS student
- Thiel Fellow
- Initially wanted to build drone company

**The Moment of Discovery:**

- Design internship at Flipboard
- Exposed to "the file problem"
- Designers working in silos
- Complex file naming conventions
- Version control nightmare
- Collaboration was painful

**Key Insight:**
> "Designers spent excessive time managing file versions and collaboration instead of creating"

**Evan Wallace's Role:**

- CS teaching assistant at Brown
- WebGL graphics expert
- Worked at Pixar and Microsoft
- Convinced Dylan to pivot from drones to design tools

**The Vision:**
> "Do for interface design what Google Docs did for text editing"

### The Repositioning Strategy

**From:** Desktop design tools (Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator)
**To:** Browser-based collaborative design ("Google Docs for design")

**Critical Market Gap:**

- Desktop tools tied to operating systems
- Mac-only (Sketch) excluded Windows users
- File-based workflow prevented real-time collaboration
- Expensive licenses
- No multiplayer editing

**Core Repositioning Insight:**
> "Design should be collaborative, accessible, and not tied to a specific operating system or expensive software license"

**How They Changed the Frame:**

1. **Browser-First Architecture:**
   - Not desktop-first with cloud sync
   - Native web application
   - Universal access (any OS, any device)
   - Permanent structural advantage

2. **Real-Time Multiplayer:**
   - Inspired by Google Docs
   - Simultaneous editing
   - Live cursors and presence
   - Natural collaboration

3. **Platform Independence:**
   - Solved Mac vs Windows problem
   - Designers on any OS
   - Developers and PMs could access on any machine
   - Broke Sketch's Mac-only lock-in

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Web browser = lower barrier to entry
   - No expensive licenses
   - Freemium model
   - Inclusive to entire product teams

**Positioning Never Attacked Adobe/Sketch Directly:**
> "Adobe doesn't really understand collaboration. The Adobe Creative Cloud is really cloud in name only."

- Occupied different category (collaborative vs solo)
- Desktop tools couldn't pivot to browser without losing native advantages
- Figma had no legacy codebase to drag along

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 2012-2015 (3 years in stealth)

**Development Philosophy:**

- Build from ground up for browser
- No compromises on performance
- Real-time multiplayer from day one
- Delayed launch 9 months to perfect collaboration

**Initial Features:**

- Vector editing in browser
- Real-time multiplayer editing
- Vector networks (innovation)
- Comments and feedback
- Sketch file import
- Version history

**Tech Stack:**

- WebGL for graphics rendering
- Browser-based (no desktop app initially)
- Optimized for performance

**Technical Innovation: Vector Networks**

- Unlike Sketch's path-based system
- Manipulation between any two points

**Date:** 2015 (public launch), 2016 (broader availability)

**Pre-launch:**

- 3 years building in stealth
- Invited early beta users
- Perfected core experience

**Launch Positioning:**
> "Figma vs Goliath" - 23-year-old's design tool fights Adobe

**Launch Results:**

- Strong initial traction from designers
- Word-of-mouth in design community
- "Finally, collaboration for design!"

**Unique Approach:**

- Freemium from day one
- No paywalls for core features

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Early Adoption (2015-2017)

**Market Share:** <10% (2017)

**Strategy:**

- Word-of-mouth in design community
- Free tier drove adoption
- Sketch import made switching easy
- Focus on product quality

**Growth Tactics:**

- Remove switching costs (Sketch import)
- Free tier for individuals
- Viral collaboration (share link = demo)
- Community building

#### Phase 2: Market Share Acceleration (2017-2020)

**Growth Drivers:**

- Real-time collaboration became essential (COVID-19 accelerated)
- Platform independence (Windows users could finally use pro tool)
- Developers and PMs joined (browser-based = accessible)
- Team adoption drove paid conversions

**Competitive Dynamics:**
> "In the same way that they flocked from Photoshop to Sketch, they dropped Sketch (and with it, InVision) for Figma"

**Market Share Growth:**

- Fastest shift in design tool adoption ever
- Sketch couldn't compete on collaboration
- InVision lost relevance (prototyping in Figma)

#### Phase 3: Market Dominance (2020-2022)

**Market Share:** 90% (2022)

- 10% → 90% in 5 years
- Unprecedented velocity

**Enterprise Adoption:**

- Microsoft requested pricing (couldn't use free tools)
- Free tier actually blocked enterprise adoption initially
- Charging enabled enterprise legitimacy

**Product Expansion:**

- **FigJam (2021):** Brainstorming/whiteboarding
- **Dev Mode (2023):** Developer handoff
- Expanded from designers to entire product teams

#### Phase 4: Adobe Acquisition (2022)

**Acquisition:**

- $20B Adobe purchase (2022)
- Regulatory scrutiny (blocked in some regions)
- Integration ongoing

**Market Position:**

- Clear category leader
- Design collaboration standard
- Replacing desktop tools

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision: Browser-first, not desktop-first**
   - **Why:** Collaboration requires web architecture
   - **Reasoning:** Desktop tools fundamentally can't do multiplayer well
   - **Result:** Permanent structural advantage, platform independence

2. **Decision: Delay launch 9 months for multiplayer perfection**
   - **Why:** Collaboration was core differentiator
   - **Reasoning:** Had to be flawless, not half-baked
   - **Result:** "It just works" reputation from day one

3. **Decision: Vector networks (technical innovation)**
   - **Why:** Differentiate on technology, not just collaboration
   - **Reasoning:** Create technical moat
   - **Result:** Superior editing experience, hard to replicate

4. **Decision: Sketch import feature**
   - **Why:** Remove switching costs
   - **Reasoning:** Make migration frictionless
   - **Result:** Designers could try Figma without abandoning work

5. **Decision: Free tier (initially blocked enterprise)**
   - **Why:** Lower barrier to adoption
   - **Reasoning:** Viral growth > immediate revenue
   - **Context:** Microsoft requested pricing (couldn't use free tools)
   - **Result:** Had to add paid tier for enterprise legitimacy

6. **Decision: Slack integration**
   - **Why:** Meet designers where they work
   - **Reasoning:** Notifications in existing workflow, not separate
   - **Result:** Embedded into daily habits

7. **Decision: Expand beyond design (FigJam, Dev Mode)**
   - **Why:** Increase addressable market
   - **Reasoning:** Designers collaborate with PMs, developers
   - **Result:** Entire product teams on Figma

### Pivots & Changes

**Minor Pivot: Dylan's Original Idea**

- **From:** Drone company
- **To:** Design tool (convinced by Evan Wallace)
- **Why:** Evan's graphics expertise, market opportunity
- **Result:** Found better product-market fit

**No Major Product Pivots:**

- Core vision stayed consistent (collaborative design)
- Stayed true to browser-first architecture

**Expansion, Not Pivot:**

- Started: Design tool
- Added: Prototyping, whiteboarding (FigJam), dev handoff (Dev Mode)
- Strategy: Expand within product workflow

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel: Product-Led Growth (Viral Loop)**

- Share link = live demo
- Collaborators become users
- Free tier drives adoption
- **Cost:** Free tier infrastructure
- **Result:** Primary growth driver

**Secondary Channels:**
