## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Origin: Failed Game Company (2009-2012)**

- Stewart Butterfield and Cal Henderson founded Tiny Speck (2009)
- Built massively multiplayer web game: Glitch
- Launched September 27, 2011
- Failed to attract sufficient audience
- Shut down game in 2012

**The Accidental Discovery:**
> "Stewart and his team noticed they were using their internal chat tool more than email to communicate"

**Key Insight:**

- Internal tool was more valuable than the game
- Team communication was broken
- Email was terrible for team coordination
- IRC and HipChat existed but had <30% market penetration
- **70-80% of teams used "nothing"** for centralized communication

**Context:**

- This was Stewart's **second** accidental success
- Flickr also emerged from failed game project
- Pattern: Internal tools from failed games became billion-dollar products

### The Repositioning Strategy

**From:** IRC / Email / "Nothing" (fragmented communication)
**To:** Team communication hub (centralized, searchable, integrated)

**Core Repositioning Insight:**
> "70-80% of teams used 'nothing' for centralized communication—this wasn't a competitive battle, it was market education"

**How They Changed the Frame:**

1. **"Nothing" as Competitor:**
   - Not competing with HipChat/Campfire
   - Only 20-30% used existing tools
   - 70-80% had no solution
   - **Opportunity:** Create new category

2. **Email as Enemy:**
   - Positioned email as "terrible choice" for teams
   - Email = async, unstructured, unsearchable
   - Slack = real-time, organized, searchable

3. **Market Education:**
   - Educated users about inefficiency they didn't recognize
   - Fragmented communication chaos
   - "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge" (SLACK acronym)

4. **Team-Level Adoption (Not Enterprise):**
   - Bypass procurement
   - Grassroots spread
   - Organic enthusiasm over top-down mandates

**Positioning Against Incumbents:**
> "Contrary to its roaring success, Slack didn't rely on massive marketing campaigns or splashy email strategies—their growth was rooted in making customer feedback the heart of their mission"

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Late 2012 - August 2013 (9-10 months)

**Development Philosophy:**
