## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Holger Sindbaek, a 33-year-old designer-turned-developer, approached game selection methodically rather than building based on inspiration or trends.

**Research Process:**
- Scraped App Annie data for mobile games
- Created algorithm ranking apps by:
  - Estimated earnings
  - Downloads
  - Ratings
- Analyzed 16 potential games
- Selected solitaire based on criteria:
  - Achievable as weekend project
  - Proven market demand
  - Reusable code for variants (Klondike, FreeCell, Spider)

**The Insight:** Rather than chase "sexy" innovative ideas, Sindbaek chose an "unsexy" proven market where he could validate demand before building. Solitaire had established demand, achievable scope, and code reusability.

> "I chose to build an 'unsexy' app that I felt pretty sure had a market rather than a 'sexy' app where the market wasn't as clearly defined." - Holger Sindbaek

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Less than 1 month

**Initial Platform:** Mac App Store app

**Initial Features:**
- Klondike Solitaire gameplay
- Basic UI/UX
- Score tracking
- Standard solitaire rules

**Tech Stack (Original):**
- Mac app development (technology not specified, likely Swift/Objective-C)

**Tech Stack (Current Web Version):**
- Frontend: React
- Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- Hosting: Heroku and Firebase
- Described as "pretty standard"

**Development Process:**
- Data-driven game selection (scraped App Annie)
- Algorithm-based ranking of opportunities
- Built what data suggested, not personal passion
- Focused on achievable scope for solo developer

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Mac App Store

**Date:** 10+ years ago (~2012)

**Pre-launch:**
- Market research via App Annie data scraping
- Algorithm-based game selection
- No audience building mentioned

**Launch Results:**
- $32 first day ($30 in some references)
- Modest but validated demand
- Steady $20-30 daily revenue for years

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Mac App Side Project (Years 1-5, ~2012-2017)
- **What happened:** Steady $20-30/day revenue
- **Key tactic:** Maintained as side project, no pressure
- **Result:** Consistent passive income, no growth pressure
- **Quote:** "The revenue that came from it has felt like an extra bonus...which means I've never felt the pressure of relying on that income alone."

#### Phase 2: Transition to Web (Mid-period, ~2017-2020)
- **What happened:** Migrated from Mac app to web platform
- **Key tactic:** Expanded accessibility, multi-variant games
- **Result:** Broader audience reach, foundation for scaling

#### Phase 3: SEO Focus (Recent years, ~2020-2022)
- **What happened:** Aggressive on-page and off-page SEO
- **Key tactic:** Comprehensive guides, SERP optimization, embed generator
- **Result:** Traffic growth to 1M+ monthly visitors

#### Phase 4: $10K MRR Achievement (2022)
- **What happened:** Revenue crossed $10,000/month
- **Key tactic:** Traffic-driven ad revenue scaling
- **Result:** 10-year overnight success story

**Critical Insight:**
> "Try and make success happen when you still have room to fail...making $30 extra a day feels like a bonus and not a disappointing daily revenue." - Holger Sindbaek

### Key Decisions

1. **Data-Driven Game Selection Over Passion**
   - **Why:** Reduce risk, validate demand first
   - **Result:** Chose proven market (solitaire) over innovative but unproven ideas

2. **Side Project Mentality**
   - **Why:** Reduce pressure, allow long-term experimentation
   - **Result:** No burnout, sustainable 10-year journey
   - **Quote:** Running alongside other work meant revenue felt like "extra bonus"

3. **Ad-Supported Over Subscription**
   - **Why:** "People don't want to pay for solitaire games"
   - **Result:** 95% revenue from display ads (Freestar), only 5% from subscriptions
   - **Insight:** Matched user expectations and willingness to pay

4. **No Paid Advertising**
   - **Why:** "The amount I'd have to spend to get a new user is more than I'd get from the user playing the game"
   - **Result:** 100% organic growth via SEO, sustainable unit economics

5. **SEO Over Social Media**
   - **Why:** Evergreen traffic, compound growth, matches user search behavior
   - **Result:** 1M+ monthly visitors, 4M+ games played

### Pivots & Changes

- **Platform shift:** Mac App Store → Web (broader accessibility)
- **Monetization evolution:** One-time purchase → Ad-supported + optional subscription
- **Game expansion:** Single game → Multiple solitaire variants (Klondike, FreeCell, Spider)
- **Growth strategy:** Passive maintenance → Active SEO optimization

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** SEO (Organic Search)
- On-page SEO (comprehensive guides, keyword optimization)
- Off-page SEO (embed generator for backlinks)
- SERP feature optimization (featured snippets)
- Content-driven traffic growth

**Secondary Channels:**
- Embed generator: Websites can customize games with their logos/colors (difficult but effective link-building)
- Word-of-mouth: Quality gameplay driving organic sharing

**Failed/Avoided Channels:**
- Paid advertising: Economics don't work (CAC > LTV)
- Social media: Not mentioned, likely not pursued
- App store optimization: Moved away from app stores

**Why SEO Worked:**
- Users search for "solitaire" actively (high intent)
- Evergreen content compounds over time
- No ongoing acquisition cost
- Matches user discovery behavior

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Free to play with ads

**Monetization:**
- **Primary (95%):** Display advertising via Freestar
  - Ads appear after 5 games played
  - Revenue scales with traffic
- **Secondary (5%):** Optional subscription
  - Removes ads
  - Low take-up rate (users prefer free with ads)

**Business Model:**
- Ad-supported free game
- High volume, low ARPU strategy
- Scale through traffic growth

**Unit Economics:**
- 1M+ monthly visitors
- 4M+ monthly games played
- $10,000 MRR ÷ 1M visitors = $0.01 revenue per visitor
- Sustainable because CAC = $0 (organic SEO)
