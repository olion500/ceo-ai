## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Marc Lou identified a recurring pain point from his own experience building multiple SaaS products: developers waste weeks setting up the same boilerplate code (authentication, payments, email, deployment) before building their actual product.

**The Insight:** Most indie hackers and solo developers want to ship fast and validate ideas quickly, but get stuck in infrastructure setup. A NextJS boilerplate with all common integrations pre-configured would save weeks of development time.

**Market Validation:** Marc had already built multiple products himself and experienced this friction repeatedly. He was solving his own problem.

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Not disclosed (likely weeks based on complexity)

**Initial Features:**
- NextJS boilerplate with TypeScript
- Pre-configured authentication
- Stripe payment integration
- Email setup
- Database integration
- Deployment configuration
- Landing page templates
- SEO optimization
- Analytics setup

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Stripe
- Authentication (specific provider not disclosed)
- Email service integration
- Database (likely PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- Vercel deployment

**Development Process:**
- Built as a solution to his own repeated pain point
- Packaged his learnings from building multiple SaaS products
- Focused on the most time-consuming setup tasks
- Included best practices from his experience

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Twitter (primary), Product Hunt, LinkedIn

**Date:** September 1, 2023 (August 31 in some sources)

**Launch Results:**

- Viral reception in indie hacker community
- Immediate validation and revenue

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Explosive Launch (Month 1 - Sep 2023)
- **What happened:** Generated $40,000 in first month
- **Key tactic:** Twitter building in public + perfect product-market fit timing
- **Result:** Immediate success, validated concept

#### Phase 2: Rapid Scaling (Month 2 - Oct 2023)
- **What happened:** Hit $63,600 in revenue in less than 2 months total
- **Key tactic:** Word-of-mouth, continued Twitter presence, customer success stories
- **Result:** Reached $50K monthly income range total

#### Phase 3: Crossing $100K (Months 3-4 - Nov-Dec 2023)
- **What happened:** Total revenue crossed $300,000 by March 13, 2024
- **Key tactic:** Sustained momentum, continuous improvements, community building
- **Result:** Established as go-to NextJS boilerplate

#### Phase 4: Peak Performance (Early 2024)
- **What happened:** March 2024 revenue $75.1K from ShipFast alone, total income $83,212
- **Key tactic:** Multiple income sources, but ShipFast as primary
- **Result:** $133K/month run rate by April 2024

### Key Decisions

1. **Building in Public Strategy**

   - **Result:** Community rallied around the product, viral growth

2. **Solving Own Problem First**
   - **Why:** Authentic understanding of pain point, credibility as user
   - **Result:** Perfect product-market fit with indie hacker audience

3. **One-time Purchase Model (Initially)**
   - **Why:** Lower friction than subscription for developer tools
   - **Result:** Rapid adoption, high conversion

4. **Using Product to Build Itself (Meta Marketing)**
   - **Why:** Demonstrates value, "eat your own dog food" credibility
   - **Result:** Built-in case study, authentic testimonial

5. **Focus on Speed to Ship**
   - **Why:** Core value proposition aligned with indie hacker mindset
   - **Result:** Positioning as essential tool for fast validation

### Pivots & Changes

4. Peak run rate: $133K/month (April 2024)

**Business Model:**
- Digital product (boilerplate code)

- Low marginal cost (digital delivery)
- High margins (no significant variable costs)

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Differentiating from free boilerplates
   - **Solution:** Superior quality, ongoing updates, community support, time savings worth the price

2. **Challenge:** Proving value before purchase
