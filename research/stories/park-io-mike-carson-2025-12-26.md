# Park.io Success Story

## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Mike Carson discovered the domain backorder opportunity through personal experience in late 2013:

**The Trigger Event:**
- There was an expiring domain Mike wanted for a project - smile.io
- He didn't get it because someone else had better automation
- This led him to explore the domain name system in more depth
- He discovered a gap in the market for "hacker-type" domains (.io, .ly, .me, etc.)

**Key Insights:**
- Premium domains expire daily but most people don't know when
- Existing services focused on .com domains, not tech-focused TLDs
- Programmers with good automation could capture valuable domains
- There was no dedicated service for .io domain backorders
- People would pay to secure expiring domains they wanted

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for user-facing platform (had existing automation)

**Initial Features:**
- Domain backorder placement system
- Payment processing ($99 per backorder)
- Automated registration attempts when domains expire
- Basic portfolio management for caught domains
- Email notifications for successful captures

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: PHP with CakePHP framework
- Backend: Node.js scripts for automation
- Database: Not specified, likely MySQL with CakePHP
- Infrastructure: AWS EC2

**Development Process:**

**Phase 1: Personal Automation (Late 2013)**
- Built custom scripts to monitor expiring .io domains
- Created automated registration system to compete with other programmers
- Validated the model by catching and flipping domains personally

**First Sale Validation:**
- Caught a two-letter .io domain (purchased for ~$40)
- Listed on Flippa
- Sold for $2,000
- Proved the business model viability

**Phase 2: Service Platform (Early 2014)**
- Developed user-facing interface in 1-2 weeks
- Added payment processing
- Integrated existing automation backend
- Built auction system for competing orders

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Bare-bones initial build:** "Build bare-bones initially, automate repetitive tasks only after identifying patterns"
2. **Custom automation over third-party:** Built proprietary domain monitoring and registration bots
3. **AWS infrastructure:** Reliable, scalable cloud hosting
4. **PHP + Node.js:** PHP for web interface, Node.js for backend automation

**Notable Technical Features:**
- Domain data collection bots
- WhoIs analysis automation
- GitHub API integration (to check if domains used in projects)
- Estibot integration for domain appraisals
- Auction system for multiple competing orders

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Minimal marketing - organic discovery

### Key Decisions

1. **Remained Solo Founder**
   - **Why:** Valued happiness and autonomy over scale
   - **Context:** Pressure from others to hire and grow team
   - **Result:** Maintained $125K/month revenue alone, higher profit margins, personal satisfaction

2. **No Marketplace Feature**
   - **Why:** Wanted to maintain user satisfaction and service quality
   - **Context:** Users requested domain marketplace functionality
   - **Result:** Preserved focus, simpler product, happier users

3. **Transparency Over Marketing**
   - **Why:** Believed in honest business practices
   - **Context:** Could have done more aggressive marketing
   - **Result:** Strong word-of-mouth, loyal customer base, sustainable growth

4. **Custom Automation Over Third-party**
   - **Why:** Needed competitive edge in domain capture
   - **Context:** Competing with other programmers and services
   - **Result:** Superior capture rates, defensible advantage

5. **$99 Pricing Strategy**
   - **Why:** Wharton pricing expert advice: "if you aren't pricing it so high that people turn away... then you aren't pricing it high enough"
   - **Context:** Needed to validate willingness to pay
   - **Result:** High revenue per transaction, profitable from day one

### Pivots & Changes

- **No major pivots:** Business model remained consistent from launch
- **Added auction system:** When multiple users wanted same domain
- **Integrated registry service:** Added alongside proprietary system after competition emerged
- **Expanded TLD coverage:** Started with .io, added .ly, .me, .to, and others

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel: Parked Pages (Organic Discovery)**

**How It Worked:**
- Every domain caught by Park.io got a default parked page
- Page included link to Park.io service
- People searching for expired domains found Park.io
- Created self-sustaining discovery loop

**Results:**
- Zero marketing cost
- High-quality leads (already interested in domains)
- Consistent daily user acquisition
- Main growth driver for entire business

**Secondary Channels:**

**Word of Mouth:**
- Natural referrals from satisfied customers
- Developer community sharing
- No formal referral program

**Results:**
- Organic growth
- High-trust leads
- Low customer acquisition cost

**Hacker News & Tech Media:**
- Limited interviews and blog posts
- Occasional mentions
- Appearance on Indie Hackers podcast

**Results:**
- Credibility boost
- Some traffic spikes
- Secondary to parked pages

**Failed Attempts:**
- **Paid advertising:** Never attempted - "I never did much advertising"
- **Empire Flippers listing (early):** Listed business for sale without real intent, wasted significant time

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** $99 per backorder attempt

**Pricing Structure:**
- $99 flat fee per domain backorder
- Fee charged only if successful in capturing domain
- Includes one-year domain renewal
- Auction system when multiple orders for same domain (10-day auction)

**Pricing Evolution:**
- **Initial:** $99 per backorder (June 2014)
