# Sensei (Cindori) Success Story - Oskar Groth

## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Oskar Groth founded Cindori in 2013 with a simple approach: **build utility apps for personal needs first**. The market validation came organically when users began donating to support development, signaling genuine demand.

**Key Insights:**
- Started with personal pain points (third-party SSD TRIM support)
- Users willingly paid for utilities that solved real problems
- Mac ecosystem had less competition than mobile, with users willing to pay premium prices
- Desktop users valued native performance over cross-platform compatibility

**Initial Focus:**
- Created Trim Enabler (2011-2013): Utility for enabling TRIM support for third-party SSDs on macOS
- Addressed technical gap in macOS that affected hardware performance
- Validated that Mac power users would pay for system optimization tools

2. **2015:** Command Center (Control Center-style utility, 5 years before Apple's version)
3. **2019:** Sensei (flagship comprehensive Mac optimization suite)
4. **2025:** Backdrop (wallpaper engine) and Mintly (accounting platform)

**Sensei Features:**
- Disk cleaning and space management
- Application uninstallation
- Hardware temperature monitoring
- Performance metrics and dashboards
- CPU, GPU, memory, disk health analytics
- Customizable status bar monitor (written entirely in SwiftUI)

**Tech Stack:**
- **Primary Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** Initially AppKit, transitioned to SwiftUI post-Big Sur
- **Graphics:** Metal shaders for advanced visualizations
