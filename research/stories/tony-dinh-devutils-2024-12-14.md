# Tony Dinh - DevUtils, Xnapper, Typing Mind Success Story


## The "Scratching Own Itch" Philosophy

> "All of my ideas are from scratching my own itch" - Tony Dinh

Tony Dinh explicitly states that every successful product came from solving his own problems as a developer.

## Product Portfolio

### 1. DevUtils (Sept 2020) - First Success

**Personal Problem:**
- Constantly switching between online developer tools
- Tools required internet connection
- No unified interface for common dev tasks

- Works offline on macOS

**Development:**
- Built in ~2 weeks
- Abandoned 6-month failed project to build this

### 2. Black Magic (May 2021 - May 2023) - Biggest Win

**Personal Problem:**
- Wanted creative way to celebrate 1,000 Twitter followers

**Why Sold:** Twitter API pricing became $42K/month, not sustainable

### 3. Xnapper (June 2022)

**Personal Problem:**
- People constantly asked about his beautiful screenshots on Twitter

**Solution:**
- Screenshot beautification app for developers
- macOS application

### 4. Typing Mind (March 2023 - Present) - Current Main Product

- Wanted better interface for ChatGPT

**Development:**

## Success Philosophy

### Build Unfair Advantages:
- 7 years software engineering experience
- Full-stack capabilities (frontend, backend, mobile, DevOps)
- Can "build apps very fast"
- Built 97K Twitter following for distribution

### Shipping Strategy:
> "Ship early, ship small, ship frequently. Don't stuck on one idea for too long if it doesn't work."

### Focus on Core Value:
> "When building product: focus on the core value it brings to the customer."

### Multiple Products = Risk Reduction:
- Portfolio approach spreads risk
- One product crisis (Black Magic) didn't kill business
- Typing Mind filled gap when Black Magic sold

## Marketing Channels

**Primary:** Twitter (97K followers by Sept 2023)
- "Build in public" strategy
- Organic engagement
- Product Hunt launches for traffic spikes

**Secondary:**
- Newsletter (6,000+ subscribers)
- Product Hunt (traffic spikes)
- Indie Hackers community

## Work-Life Balance

**After Reaching Profitability:**
- Average 4 hours/day actual development
- Prioritized life balance: surfing, traveling, hardware learning
- Delegated customer support and non-creative tasks to team

**Lifestyle Trade-offs:**

## Key Lessons

> "Build unfair advantages for yourself" - Through specialized skills and audience ownership

**On Product Development:**
- Scratch your own itch - all successful products came from personal problems
- Ship fast, fail fast, learn fast
- Focus on core value, avoid over-engineering

**On Distribution:**
- Build audience before you need it (97K Twitter followers)
- "Build in public" creates organic engagement
- Own your distribution channel

**On Portfolio:**
- Multiple products reduce risk
- Don't get attached to single product (sold 2 successfully)
- Be ready to pivot when circumstances change (Twitter API crisis)
