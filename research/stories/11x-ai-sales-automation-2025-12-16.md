## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Hasan Sukkar's entrepreneurial journey began at age 14 when he created his first online marketplace in Syria. After immigrating to the UK at 17 as part of the Syrian refugee crisis, he pursued education and eventually worked at McKinsey as a consultant.

**Key Insight:**
While working in various roles (space-tech fund, AI engineer, McKinsey consultant), Hasan observed a fundamental problem:

> "Human potential was being wasted doing laborious tasks."

He noticed that ethnic minorities like himself were often at a disadvantage and "always had to come overly prepared." He saw this pattern across organizations: skilled people were spending their time on repetitive, laborious work instead of creating and innovating.

**The Vision:**
Rather than building another productivity tool, Hasan envisioned **AI workers** that could handle entire processes end-to-end, completely replacing the need for humans to do routine work.

> "There is a misallocation of human potential which isn't just inefficient, it's a tragedy." - Hasan Sukkar

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** September 2022 - Early 2023 (initial product)

**Initial Product: Alice (AI SDR)**

11x started by building Alice, an AI Sales Development Representative that creates sales pipelines on autopilot.

**Core Features:**

- Intelligent buyer targeting
- Personalized, adaptive email crafting
- Meeting booking at scale
- 24/7 operation in 28 languages
- Self-improvement through each interaction

**Tech Stack:**

- Built on "breakthrough AI agent research"
- Multi-LLM orchestration (specific models not disclosed)
- Proprietary conversation and email generation algorithms
- Integration with standard sales tools (CRMs, calendaring)

**Development Philosophy:**

- End-to-end automation, not just assistance
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Human results, delivered by digital workers

**Second Product: Jordan (AI Phone Rep)**

After Alice's success, 11x developed Jordan:

- Conducts natural phone conversations (up to 30 minutes)
- Handles both inbound and outbound calls
- Operates 24/7 in 28 languages
- Enhanced through acquisition of Opkit for voice capabilities

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Product-led growth (no major public launch event documented)
**Date:** Early 2023 (Alice launch)

**Pre-launch:**

- Hasan quit McKinsey to go all-in on 11x
- Built initial product with founding team in London
- Focused on revenue teams and go-to-market functions

**Launch Results:**

Instead of competing for software budgets, 11x positioned their offering to:

- Hiring managers
- Decision-makers controlling recruitment budgets
- Less saturated purchasing category than traditional SaaS

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Rapid Initial Traction (Month 0-6, 2023)

**Key Achievement:** $0 to $1M ARR in 5 months

**Tactics Used:**

1. **Product-Led Growth**: Product itself as main acquisition engine
2. **Budget Targeting**: Competed for hiring budgets, not software budgets
3. **Operational Velocity**: "5-10x the speed most people think is normal"
4. **End-to-End Solutions**: Autopilot-first offerings with measurable ROI
5. **Technical Differentiation**: Superior engineering vs legacy competitors

**Team Culture:**
> "We like to operate at 5-10x the speed most people think is normal. 50% of our team are former Founders. We're all drivers, no passengers." - Hasan Sukkar

**Funding Milestone:**

- August 2023: $2M pre-seed led by Project A Ventures
- Hasan noted fundraising was "particularly easy" due to clear AI boom scaling potential

#### Phase 2: Scaling & Product Refinement (Month 7-18, 2023-2024)

**Growth Flywheel Implementation:**
11x used Alice to sell Alice - creating a self-reinforcing growth cycle:

1. **Data Generation**: Alice produces real-world interactions and outcomes
2. **Product Improvement**: Insights from interactions refine Alice's capabilities
3. **Scaled Results**: Better-performing product drives more customer acquisition

**Creative Experimentation:**

- Tested meme-based follow-up sequences with GIFs and images

#### Phase 3: Geographic Expansion & Rapid Funding (Month 19-24, 2024)

**September 16, 2024: San Francisco Move**

- Relocated from London to San Francisco
- Reason: Most customers based in Bay Area
- Approaching $10M ARR (5x year-over-year growth)

**Within 10 days of Bay Area arrival:**

- Received **8 investment offers**
- Closed $24M Series A at $90M valuation
- Led by Benchmark; included Quiet Capital, 20VC, SV Angels, Visionaries Club

**September 30, 2024: Series B (2 weeks later!)**

- $50M at $350M valuation
- Led by Andreessen Horowitz
- Acquired Opkit to accelerate voice capabilities (Jordan product)

**Valuation Multiple:** 14x revenue (extremely high for SaaS)

**Revenue Acceleration:**

- December 2024: ~$25M ARR

- Mix of conglomerates and promising startups
- Notable customers: Siemens, ZoomInfo, Airtable, Pleo, ElevenLabs

**Product Roadmap:**

- January 2025: Alice 2.0 launch planned

**Leadership Change:**

- May 2025: Hasan Sukkar stepped down as CEO
- CTO Prabhav Jain named new CEO
- Hasan moved to non-executive chairman role

### Key Decisions

1. **AI Workers, Not Tools**
   - **Why:** Traditional SaaS tools enhance productivity but don't replace work
   - **Result:** Differentiated positioning, higher willingness-to-pay, hiring budget access
   - **Quote:** "People don't want to buy tools for reps, they want to buy an actual AI rep that does the work" - Hasan Sukkar

2. **Self-Use as Growth Strategy**
   - **Why:** Best way to prove product works and generate improvement insights
   - **Result:** 50% MoM growth, 10,000 demo requests in 10 months
   - **Outcome:** Self-reinforcing flywheel where product improves as it's used

3. **Speed as Competitive Advantage**
   - **Why:** Hasan believed operating velocity compounds advantages
   - **Result:** Hired 50% former founders, "all drivers, no passengers"
   - **Outcome:** $0 to $1M ARR in 5 months, two funding rounds in 2 weeks

4. **Geographic Move to San Francisco**
   - **Why:** Customer concentration and investor network access
   - **Result:** 8 investment offers within 10 days, $74M raised in 2 weeks
   - **Outcome:** Accelerated growth trajectory, better customer proximity

5. **Strategic Acquisition (Opkit)**
   - **Why:** Needed voice/phone capabilities for Jordan product
   - **Result:** Faster time-to-market than building from scratch
   - **Outcome:** Jordan launched with 30-minute conversation capabilities

6. **Gated Expansion**
   - **Why:** Maintain customer experience quality despite massive demand
   - **Result:** Deliberately controlled growth despite 10,000 demo requests
   - **Outcome:** Lower churn, stronger product-market fit

### Pivots & Changes

  - **Why:** Complex automation workflows better fit for larger organizations
  - **Result:** Higher contract values, lower churn, better unit economics

  - **Why:** Customer and investor concentration in Bay Area
  - **Result:** Funding velocity increased dramatically (2 rounds in 2 weeks)

  - **Why:** Not publicly disclosed (speculation: scaling challenges vs building challenges)
  - **Result:** Hasan moves to chairman, Prabhav Jain becomes CEO

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** Product-Led Growth + Self-Use

- Alice selling Alice created authentic case studies and continuous improvement

**Secondary Channels:**

1. **Founder Social Media (Hasan's LinkedIn)**
   - Transparency posts about milestones ($0 to $1M ARR)
   - **Results:** Significant inbound interest from transparency
   - **Quote:** Hasan's LinkedIn posts about tactics went viral in startup community

2. **PR & Media Coverage**
   - TechCrunch, Forbes, AI-focused publications
   - **Results:** Brand awareness in target market
   - **Timing:** Coordinated with funding announcements

3. **Creative Outbound Tactics**
   - Meme-based follow-up sequences
   - **Results:** 35% response rates on cold pipeline re-engagement
   - **Innovation:** GIFs and images in sequences, outperformed case studies

**Failed/Not-Attempted:**

- Traditional advertising (not needed due to PLG success)
- Large sales team (AI workers handled it)
- Content marketing (not primary focus)

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Subscription-based (specific pricing not publicly disclosed)

**Pricing Structure:**

- Likely seat-based or outcome-based (meetings booked, calls handled)
- Positioned against hiring budgets, not software budgets
- Premium pricing given 14x revenue valuation multiple

**Customer LTV:** Not disclosed
**CAC:** Extremely low due to product-led growth
**Churn Rate:** Not disclosed (but "gated expansion for quality" suggests focus on retention)

**Revenue Breakdown:**

- Alice (AI SDR) - Primary revenue driver
- Jordan (AI phone rep) - Newer product line
- Future: 20 additional AI agents planned for 2025

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Scaling while maintaining quality with 10,000 demo requests
   - **Solution:** Deliberately gated expansion, controlled onboarding pace
   - **Result:** Maintained customer experience quality, lower churn

2. **Challenge:** Competing against established sales tools (Salesforce, Outreach, etc.)
   - **Solution:** Positioned as replacement for *people*, not software
   - **Result:** Accessed hiring budgets instead of software budgets

3. **Challenge:** Building complex AI agents requires significant technical depth
   - **Solution:** Hired 50% former founders, emphasized technical differentiation
   - **Result:** Superior product capabilities vs competitors

4. **Challenge:** Need for voice capabilities for Jordan
   - **Solution:** Acquired Opkit instead of building from scratch
   - **Result:** Faster time-to-market, better product

5. **Challenge:** (Speculated) Leadership transition needs
   - **Solution:** Founder stepped down as CEO, CTO took over (May 2025)
   - **Result:** Too early to assess (announced May 2025)

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "People don't want to buy tools for reps, they want to buy an actual AI rep that does the work" - Hasan Sukkar

**Context:** This was the core insight that differentiated 11x from traditional sales tools. Instead of enhancing human productivity, they replaced human labor entirely.

> "We like to operate at 5-10x the speed most people think is normal. 50% of our team are former Founders. We're all drivers, no passengers." - Hasan Sukkar

**Context:** Explaining how they achieved $0 to $1M ARR in 5 months. Operational velocity as a compounding competitive advantage.

> "There is a misallocation of human potential which isn't just inefficient, it's a tragedy." - Hasan Sukkar

**Context:** The philosophical motivation behind 11x - freeing humans from repetitive work to focus on creative and innovative tasks.

**Additional Lessons:**

- Product-led growth with self-use creates authentic proof points and continuous product improvement
- Competing in less saturated budget categories (hiring vs software) enables faster sales cycles
- Speed compounds - operating faster than competitors creates exponential advantages over time
- Hiring former founders creates "all drivers" culture that moves exceptionally fast

### What They Say Didn't Work

**Note:** Hasan and team have not publicly shared significant failures or tactics that didn't work. The company's trajectory has been exceptionally smooth compared to typical startups.

**Inferred Challenges:**

- Traditional SMB self-serve didn't work as well as mid-market/enterprise (evidenced by pivot)
- May have encountered scaling challenges leading to CEO transition (speculative, not confirmed)

### Their Advice to Others

> "We're at day 0.1" - Hasan Sukkar (February 2024, after reaching $1M ARR)

**Context:** Despite rapid success, Hasan emphasized this was just the beginning. Maintaining hunger and growth mindset even after early wins.

**Implied Advice (from tactics):**

1. Use your own product if possible - creates authentic case studies and improvement loops
2. Hire former founders and operators who can drive independently
3. Operate at speed that feels uncomfortable - "5-10x normal"
4. Position against less competitive budget categories when possible
5. Don't be afraid to relocate to where customers and capital are concentrated
6. Gate expansion to maintain quality - growth at all costs can backfire
