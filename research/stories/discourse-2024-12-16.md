# Discourse Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Jeff Atwood's Insight:** Forums hadn't evolved since the early 2000s while the rest of the web had transformed with real-time updates, mobile responsiveness, and social features.

**Key Problem:** Traditional forum software (phpBB, vBullet in) was outdated, difficult to use on mobile, and lacked modern UX.

**Target:** Communities that wanted discussion forums but with 2013-level user experience.

## License & Open Source Strategy

**License:** GNU General Public License Version 2.0 (or later)
- Strong copyleft ensures derivatives stay open
- Prevents competitors from making proprietary forks
- Builds trust with developer community

## Business Model Evolution

### Initial Strategy
**Hosted Services Model from Day One**

**Insight:** Most communities don't want to manage infrastructure
- Self-hosting requires technical expertise
- Server maintenance is time-consuming
- Security updates are critical but annoying

**Solution:** Offer official Discourse hosting

### Pricing Evolution

**Phase 1: Two Tiers (2013-2015)**
- Business: $200/month
- Enterprise: $1,000/month

**Phase 2: Three Tiers (2015+)**
- Standard: $100/month (added at 2-year anniversary)
- Business: $200/month  
- Enterprise: $1,000/month

**Key Decision:** Added lower tier to capture smaller communities

## Growth Journey

### Year 1 (Feb 2013 - Feb 2014)
- Launch of open source project
- Initial hosted customers
- Building product and community

### Year 2 (Feb 2014 - Feb 2015)
- Growing customer base
- Product maturation

### Year 3 (Feb 2015 - Feb 2016)
- Added Standard tier ($100/month)

### Year 4+ (2016 - 2017)

## Key Decisions

### 1. **GPL License (Not Open Core)**

### 2. **Hosted Service as Primary Revenue**

### 3. **Free Self-Hosting Option**

### 4. **Added Lower Price Tier**

## Revenue Model

**Primary:** Hosted Discourse
- Standard: $100/month
