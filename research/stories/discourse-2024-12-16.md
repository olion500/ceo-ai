## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Jeff Atwood's Insight:** Forums hadn't evolved since the early 2000s while the rest of the web had transformed with real-time updates, mobile responsiveness, and social features.

**Key Problem:** Traditional forum software (phpBB, vBullet in) was outdated, difficult to use on mobile, and lacked modern UX.

**Target:** Communities that wanted discussion forums but with 2013-level user experience.

## License & Open Source Strategy

**License:** GNU General Public License Version 2.0 (or later)
- **100% free and open source**
- Anyone can self-host on their own infrastructure
- No artificial limitations or "open core" model
- Truly open source, not just source-available

**Why GPL:**
- Strong copyleft ensures derivatives stay open
- Prevents competitors from making proprietary forks
- Builds trust with developer community

---

## Business Model Evolution

### Initial Strategy
**Hosted Services Model from Day One**

**Insight:** Most communities don't want to manage infrastructure
- Self-hosting requires technical expertise
- Server maintenance is time-consuming
- Security updates are critical but annoying

**Solution:** Offer official Discourse hosting

### Pricing Evolution

**Phase 1: Two Tiers (2013-2015)**
- Business: $200/month
- Enterprise: $1,000/month

**Phase 2: Three Tiers (2015+)**
- Standard: $100/month (added at 2-year anniversary)
- Business: $200/month  
- Enterprise: $1,000/month

**Key Decision:** Added lower tier to capture smaller communities

## Key Decisions

### 1. **GPL License (Not Open Core)**
- **Decision:** Full GPL, no proprietary features
- **Why:** Build trust, prevent competitive forks
- **Trade-off:** Could have charged for "premium features"
- **Result:** Strong community trust and contributions

### 2. **Hosted Service as Primary Revenue**
- **Decision:** Make money from hosting, not licenses
- **Why:** Communities value convenience over cost
- **Result:** Sustainable recurring revenue

### 3. **Free Self-Hosting Option**
- **Decision:** Fully support self-hosted deployments
- **Why:** Acquire customers, build community
- **Result:** Free tier becomes marketing funnel

### 4. **Added Lower Price Tier**
- **Decision:** $100/month Standard plan at 2-year mark
- **Why:** Capture smaller communities
- **Result:** Expanded addressable market
