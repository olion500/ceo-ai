## The Story

### Problem Discovery

In late 2020, Luca "poncle" Galante was **unemployed** and working on a mobile gambling game when he decided to create something for himself. He was frustrated with his day job prospects and wanted a creative outlet that wasn't tied to exploitative monetization.

Galante was inspired by **Magic Survival**, a 2019 mobile game featuring a character that automatically attacks enemies. He saw potential in this "survivors-like" gameplay mechanic but wanted to explore it in his own way.

The initial goal was remarkably modest:
- Create a small game to practice coding
- Release for free on itch.io
- Hope to get **100 people to play it**
- The game initially **failed to reach even this modest goal** on itch.io

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** December 2020 - March 2021 (initial version)

**Development Environment:**
- Built using **Phaser framework** (HTML5/JavaScript)
- Solo development while unemployed
- Initial version took approximately 3-4 months
- Browser-based game (free on itch.io)

**Initial Investment:** £1,100 spent on:
- Visual assets
- Audio/music
- Art resources

**Core Game Mechanics:**
- Auto-attacking character (inspired by Magic Survival)
- Waves of enemies
- Power-up selection system
- Simple pixel art aesthetic
- Minimalist UI
- Addictive "one more run" gameplay loop

**Tech Stack:**
- Phaser framework (HTML5)
- JavaScript
- Later ported to better engine after success

### Launch Strategy

**Phase 1: itch.io Launch (March 31, 2021)**
- **Platform:** itch.io (free browser game)
- **Price:** Free
- **Goal:** Get 100 players
- **Result:** **Failed to reach goal initially**
- **Audience:** Minimal, obscure

**Phase 2: Steam Early Access (December 17, 2021)**
- **Platform:** Steam
- **Price:** $2.99
- **Reasoning:** "Priced in a fair way, not a smart way" reflecting bare bones construction
- **Target:** PC gamers, roguelike fans

**Breakthrough Moment:**
- YouTuber **SplatterCat** created a video about Vampire Survivors
- Within **6 days** of SplatterCat's video, Galante set up **Poncle company**
- By late January 2022: Over 30,000 concurrent players on Steam
- February 2022: Surpassed 70,000 concurrent players

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Obscurity (March - November 2021, Months 0-8)
- Free browser game on itch.io failed to gain traction
- Less than 100 players
- Galante accepted the project might not find an audience
- Continued development as passion project

#### Phase 2: Steam Launch & Discovery (December 2021, Month 9)
- Released on Steam Early Access for $2.99
- Initial sales modest
- Word-of-mouth starting to build
- Roguelike community beginning to notice

#### Phase 3: Viral Breakthrough (January 2022, Month 10)

- **Within 6 days**:

- Price raised to $4.99 as content expanded
- Galante quit new job (had been employed only 1 week in January)
- Made first hires to expand development

#### Phase 5: Company Building (March - October 2022)
- **8 months after viral moment**: Poncle grew to 6 employees
- Continued content updates during Early Access
- Multi-platform porting began (mobile, console)
- **October 2022**: Full release (Version 1.0)

#### Phase 6: Mature Success (2022-2024)

- **Mobile**: 3 million downloads in first months (January 2023)
- **Developer net worth**: £40 million (Sunday Times estimate, August 2024)
- Became cultural phenomenon and spawned "survivors-like" genre

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision: Release for free on itch.io first**
   - **Why:** No confidence game would succeed, low barrier for testing
   - **Result:** Failed to get 100 players, but validated core gameplay for himself

2. **Decision: Port to Steam for $2.99**
   - **Why:** Wanted to reach broader audience, validate if anyone would pay
   - **Result:** Critical decision that led to discovery by YouTube creators

3. **Decision: Incorporate Poncle within 6 days of viral moment**
   - **Why:** Recognized need to formalize business immediately
   - **Result:** Professional structure in place for rapid growth

4. **Decision: Quit new job after only 1 week (January 2022)**
   - **Why:** Game revenue already exceeding salary potential
   - **Result:** Full-time focus on Vampire Survivors

5. **Decision: Raise price from $2.99 to $4.99**
   - **Why:** Adding more content, game value increased
   - **Result:** Revenue increased while maintaining strong sales

6. **Decision: Hire team rather than stay solo**
   - **Why:** Needed better engine, multi-platform ports, more content
   - **Result:** Poncle grew to 20 employees, expanded to all major platforms

7. **Decision: Focus on content updates during Early Access**
   - **Why:** Keep community engaged, deliver on promises
   - **Result:** Sustained momentum through 2022, successful 1.0 launch

### Pivots & Changes

- Started as free browser game
- Pivoted to $2.99 paid Steam game

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What Luca Galante Said

> "When Galante first started working on the project in his spare time, he was just hoping to get 100 people to play the game on Itch.io, a goal it originally failed to reach."

Context: Setting modest expectations helped him continue when initial launch failed.

> "It wasn't priced in a smart way, it was priced in a fair way"

Context: Galante valued fairness over profit maximization, pricing to reflect actual game value at time.

> "Vampire Survivors saved its creator from working on mobile gambling games"

Context: The game's success allowed escape from exploitative mobile game industry.

### What the Journey Shows

- **Unemployment to multi-millionaire in 3 years**: From jobless coder to £40M net worth
- **Initial failure doesn't mean final failure**: Failed itch.io launch led to Steam success
- **Right platform matters**: Same game, different platform (itch.io vs Steam) = different outcome
- **Streamability = discoverability**: Gameplay perfect for YouTube/Twitch drove viral growth
- **Incorporate fast when things take off**: 6 days from viral moment to company formation
- **Low price + great gameplay beats marketing budget**: $0 marketing, relied on product quality

### The Transformation
