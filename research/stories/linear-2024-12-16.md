# Linear Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Karri Saarinen's frustration with existing project management tools sparked Linear's creation:

**The Moment:**
> "When I first started using it [Jira], I thought, 'Why is it so messy and complicated?'"

**Context:** 2015, Karri joined Airbnb as Principal Designer

**The Problem:**

- Jira (industry standard) had terrible UX
- Engineers and product teams **lost enthusiasm** when opening project management software
- Legacy tools (especially Jira) = "complexity, bloat, and loss of momentum"
- Tools optimized for IT leadership/procurement, not actual users (ICs)

**The Hack:**

- Karri created **Chrome extension** with custom CSS for Airbnb's Jira instance
- Changed colors, styling, hierarchy of views
- Removed unnecessary elements

**Key Insight:**
> "Engineers and product managers losing enthusiasm when they opened their project management software"

**Founder Background:**

  - Previously founded Y Combinator startup → sold to Coinbase

**Shared Pain:** All three experienced identical frustration at their companies (Airbnb, Coinbase, Uber)

### The Repositioning Strategy

**From:** Enterprise workflow software (complex, customizable, feature-rich)
**To:** Developer-first project management (fast, focused, opinionated)

**Core Repositioning Insight:**
> "Build for the people who actually use the tool" (not IT buyers)

**Critical Market Gap:**

- Incumbent tools (Jira) optimized for procurement and IT leadership
- Individual contributors (engineers, designers, PMs) = actual daily users were ignored
- Performance was afterthought ("Why is it so slow?")

**How They Changed the Frame:**

1. **Performance as Foundation:**
   - Speed wasn't a feature—it was the architecture
   - Never allow sluggish interactions (Jira's #1 complaint)

2. **Designed Constraints (vs Endless Customization):**
   - Strong opinions over flexibility
   - Apple philosophy: "Good workflow" is opinionated
   - **Quote:** "I don't think you can build the optimal tool if it's very flexible or endlessly customizable"

3. **Quality as First Principle:**
   - Remained profitable from 2021 onward
   - Freedom to prioritize craftsmanship over growth metrics
   - "Craft and focus still win in product building"

4. **New Category Creation:**
   - Not "Jira alternative"
   - **Developer-first project management** (new category)
   - Jira = enterprise workflow software

**Positioning Never Attacked Jira Directly:**

- Occupied different category
- Jira couldn't optimize for ICs without cannibalizing enterprise revenue
- Linear had no legacy customers demanding old features

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** March 2019 - April 2019 (1+ year validation, then rapid build)

**Pre-Development Validation (Over 1 Year):**

- Informal research with engineers, designers, PMs
- Consistent complaint: **tool slowness**
- Validated pain point across companies

**Development Philosophy:**
> "We were the first ideal customer. So we just had to build something nice for ourselves that actually worked."

**Initial Features:**

- Deep functionality from day one (not minimal MVP)
- Built something they could use daily themselves
- Performance-optimized architecture (not retrofitted later)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Clean, minimalist design
- Fast interactions (no loading states)

**Tech Stack:**

- Not fully disclosed
- Performance-optimized from ground up
- Web-based with native feel

**Development Process:**

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Private beta via blog post + email waitlist
**Date:** April 2019 (private beta), April 2020 (public launch)

**Pre-launch (Private Beta):**

**Launch Copy as Filter:**
> "Saarinen wrote messaging that would resonate with frustrated developers like himself, naturally attracting people experiencing identical pain."

**Validation Tactic:**

- Survey asking about current pain points
- Identified most motivated prospects

**Public Launch (April 2020):**

- After reaching ~1,000 daily active users
- Already had product-market fit signals
- Controlled, deliberate expansion

**Launch Results:**

- Strong initial traction from developer community
- Word-of-mouth driven growth
- Cultural resonance (founder empathy story)

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Private Beta & Validation (2019-2020)

**Strategy:**

- Controlled waitlist (10K signups, ~10% admitted)
- Weekly user additions (~10/week)
- Deep engagement with early users
- Product refinement based on IC feedback

**Funding:**

- Validated private beta success

**Key Metrics:**

- ~1,000 daily active users by public launch (April 2020)

#### Phase 2: Public Launch & Product-Market Fit (2020-2021)

**April 2020:** Public launch

**Growth Tactics:**

- Word-of-mouth from developer communities
- Chrome extension origin story became mythic
- Vertical expansion (not audience expansion)
  - Added project briefs
  - Added roadmaps
  - Added customer feedback features
- Stayed focused on IC workflows (didn't chase new customer types)

**Cultural Resonance:**
> "A leader who literally couldn't tolerate a tool's problems and built his own solution inspired others to believe this team understood their pain."

**Profitability:**

- "Negative lifetime burn rate" (holding more cash than raised)

#### Phase 3: Enterprise & Scale (2021-2025)

**Series C (2024):**

- $82M raised (Accel led, Sequoia participated)

- OpenAI
- Ramp
- Vercel
- Fast-growing startups

**Team:**

- Only **80 employees** at $1.25B valuation
- Remote-first setup
- Lean, efficient operation

**Market Position:**

- Winning fast-growing startups
- Enterprises willing to adopt non-traditional vendor
- "The default startup's choice"

**Marketing Budget:**

- Lifetime marketing: **$35K total**
- $400M valuation achieved on minimal marketing spend
- Product quality drove word-of-mouth

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision: Speed as non-negotiable foundation**
   - **Why:** Slowness was #1 complaint from user research
   - **Reasoning:** "All of them [existing tools] are quite bad" - performance could differentiate
   - **Result:** Fast interactions became signature, not retrofitted feature

2. **Decision: Designed constraints (not endless customization)**
   - **Why:** Optimal workflow requires opinions, not flexibility
   - **Reasoning:** "I don't think you can build the optimal tool if it's very flexible"
   - **Quote:** Following Apple's philosophy of strong opinions
   - **Result:** Product stayed focused, avoided feature bloat

3. **Decision: 1+ year in private beta before public launch**
   - **Why:** Needed to validate with real users, refine quality
   - **Reasoning:** "Avoiding premature scaling"
   - **Result:** ~1,000 DAU with strong engagement before public launch, PMF validated

4. **Decision: Profitability focus over growth-at-any-cost**
   - **Why:** Freedom to prioritize craftsmanship
   - **Reasoning:** "Quality as first principle"
   - **Result:** Profitable since 2021, "negative lifetime burn rate", $1.25B valuation with 80 employees

5. **Decision: Build for ICs (individual contributors), not buyers**
   - **Why:** Actual users were ignored by incumbents
   - **Reasoning:** "Build for the people who actually use the tool"
   - **Result:** Developer adoption, bottom-up enterprise penetration

6. **Decision: Minimal marketing spend ($35K lifetime)**
   - **Why:** Product quality drove word-of-mouth
   - **Reasoning:** Resources better spent on product than ads
   - **Result:** $400M valuation on $35K marketing, organic growth

### Pivots & Changes

**No Major Pivots:**

- Core vision stayed consistent (developer-first, fast, quality)
- Stayed true to IC focus

**Vertical Expansion (Not Pivot):**

- Started: Issue tracking
- Added: Project briefs, roadmaps, customer feedback

**Iterative Refinement:**

- Private beta refinements based on user feedback
- Performance optimizations (ongoing)
- Feature additions for IC workflows

3. **Challenge:** Convincing enterprises to adopt non-traditional tool
   - **Solution:** Bottom-up adoption (individuals → teams → enterprise)
   - **Tactic:** Free tier / startup pricing → paid team → enterprise accounts
   - **Result:** OpenAI, Ramp, Vercel adopted despite being non-traditional

4. **Challenge:** Scaling quality while growing
   - **Solution:** Stay small (80 employees), remote-first, focus on craft
   - **Tactic:** Profitability enables quality focus over growth metrics
   - **Result:** $1.25B valuation with 80 people

5. **Challenge:** Avoiding feature bloat
