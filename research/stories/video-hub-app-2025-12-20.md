# Video Hub App Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Video organization and management software solutions lacked:
- Simple, affordable options
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Local-first privacy
- Lifetime purchase model vs. subscriptions

Boris identified the need for straightforward video library organization that respects user ownership.

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Pre-November 2018 launch

**Initial Features:**
- Video organization and cataloging
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Local file management
- Search and browse functionality

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Angular
- Framework: Electron (cross-platform desktop)
- Open source: Available on GitHub (whyboris/Video-Hub-App)

**Development Approach:**
- Built as open source from start
- Balanced commercial sales with community access
- Focused on simplicity and core use case

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Hacker News
**Date:** November 2018

**Launch Results:**
- Initial traction from HN community
- Established baseline of monthly sales
- Created awareness in developer community

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Launch and Initial Traction (2018)
- November 2018: Posted to Hacker News
- Gained initial users and feedback
- Established open source repository
- First sales at $5 price point

#### Phase 2: Organic Growth (2019-2020)
- "Got lucky that several individuals reviewed my app on their blogs"
- Word-of-mouth spread through video community
- Listed on AlternativeTo.net (discovery platform)
- Minimal active promotion

#### Phase 3: Sustained Revenue (2021-2023)
- ~100 sales/month established
- $500/month revenue sustained
- Occasional Reddit and HN mentions "where fitting"
- Platform discovery driving steady traffic

#### Phase 4: Long-term Persistence (2024-2025+)
- 8-year sustained operation
- Same $5 lifetime pricing maintained
- Continued charitable giving ($3.50/sale)
- Minimal marketing required
- AlternativeTo.net listing driving consistent traffic

### Key Decisions

1. **Lifetime Purchase at $5**
   - **Why:** Low barrier to entry, clear value proposition, no subscription fatigue
   - **Result:** 100 sales/month sustained over 8 years = 9,600+ lifetime customers

2. **70% Charitable Donation**
   - **Why:** $3.50 of every $5 sale to Against Malaria Foundation
   - **Result:** Social impact positioning, founder fulfillment, differentiation

3. **Open Source + Commercial**
   - **Why:** Community contribution while sustaining development
   - **Result:** GitHub presence, transparency, dual distribution model

4. **Minimal Marketing Strategy**
   - **Why:** Time and resource constraints, passive discovery works
   - **Result:** "Haven't promoted it much for several years," still sustained revenue

5. **Cross-Platform from Day 1**
   - **Why:** Windows, Mac, Linux support expands addressable market
   - **Result:** Broader user base, no platform limitations

### Pivots & Changes

**No major pivots:** Remarkably consistent over 8 years
- Same $5 price maintained
- Same charitable structure
- Same core product value
- Same minimal marketing approach

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** Platform Discovery

- Users searching for video organization tools find naturally

**Secondary Channels:**
- Hacker News (initial launch, occasional mentions "where fitting")
- Reddit (selective sharing in relevant communities)
- Blogger reviews ("got lucky" with organic coverage)
- Word-of-mouth referrals

**What Didn't Work:**
- Active promotion not necessary - passive discovery sufficient
- No paid advertising mentioned

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** $5 lifetime purchase

**Unit Economics:**
- Price: $5/sale
- Founder take: $1.50 (30%)
- Charity donation: $3.50 (70%)
- Volume: ~100 sales/month
- Monthly revenue: ~$500
- Annual revenue: ~$6,000

**Customer LTV:**

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "I have mild success at $500/month by selling my $5 Video Hub App" - [Context: Describing sustained, modest revenue over years]

> "I donate $3.50 of every purchase to a cost-effective charity" - [Context: 70% charitable giving as core business model]

> "I got lucky that several individuals reviewed my app on their blogs" - [Context: Organic discovery without active promotion]

**Key working strategies:**
- Extreme low pricing ($5) removes purchase friction
- Lifetime model avoids subscription fatigue
- Open source builds trust with developer audience
- Platform discovery (AlternativeTo.net) drives consistent traffic
- 8 years of persistence compounds results

### What They Say Didn't Work

> "I haven't promoted it much for several years" - [Context: Active marketing not necessary, implies initial attempts may not have been worth effort]

**Implied lessons:**
- Active promotion beyond initial launch not required
- Quality product + good placement > aggressive marketing
- Patience and persistence > growth hacks

### Their Advice to Others

(Implied from execution):
- Start with strong platform launch (HN)
- Price low enough to eliminate purchase hesitation
- Open source can coexist with commercial
- Focus on discovery platforms, not active marketing
- Persistence matters - 8 years of steady beats quick spikes
- Charitable component adds meaning beyond revenue
