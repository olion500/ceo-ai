## The "Built for Myself" Story

> "Kyle built ProjectionLab simply because he wanted a better plan for his own financial future."

### Personal Problem

**Kyle's Frustration:**
- Planning for FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)
- Existing financial planning tools were:
  - Ugly and outdated
  - Too complex or too simple
  - Not designed for FIRE community
  - Expensive or limited

**The Insight:**
> "The fact that so many others wanted that too came as a surprise."

Kyle built it for himself first, not expecting it would become a business.
