## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Antoine van der Lee started as an iOS Developer in 2010 and worked at WeTransfer from March 2017 as a Senior iOS Engineer & Team Lead. While working on the Collect productivity app and the official WeTransfer iOS, iPadOS, and macOS app, he identified a recurring pain point: **testing deep links in iOS development was cumbersome and time-consuming**.

**Key insights:**

- Deep link testing required manual setup and repetitive workflows
- No good developer tools existed for this specific problem
- As a developer himself, he had firsthand experience with the pain
- The problem was universal across iOS development teams

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 2019 (initial version)

**Initial Features:**

- Deep links tester
- Basic simulator testing capabilities
- Focused on solving one specific problem well

**Tech Stack:**

- macOS native app
- Swift/SwiftUI
- Xcode integration

**Development Process:**

- Built in spare time while working full-time at WeTransfer
- Solved his own problem first ("dogfooding")
- Initially released as a simple utility tool

**Costs:**

- Minimal initial investment (solo development, no external costs)
- Website hosting and basic infrastructure

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Organic growth, developer community

**Pre-launch:**

- Had existing audience from SwiftLee blog (started 2015)
- 9 years of consistent content creation built trust

**Launch Results:**

- Gradual adoption within iOS developer community
- Apple recognition as "Essential Developer Tool"
- No viral launch, but steady organic growth

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Side Project Era (2019-2022)

**Revenue: $0 → $80 MRR**

- Built RocketSim while working full-time at WeTransfer
- Maintained SwiftLee blog with weekly posts
- Grew Twitter following to 60K
- Newsletter reached 19.5K subscribers
- Focused on audience building over immediate monetization

**Key activities:**

- Weekly blog posts about Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode
- Active engagement on Twitter/X
- Guest lectures and community building
- Building reputation as iOS development expert

#### Phase 2: 4-Day Work Week (Jan 2023 - Mar 2024)

**Revenue: $1,126 MRR → $4,512 MRR (4x growth in 1 year)**

**Critical decision:** Negotiated 4-day work week at WeTransfer instead of quitting immediately

**Why this worked:**

- Dedicated one full day per week to side projects
- Reduced risk while maintaining salary
- Accelerated growth significantly (14x MRR growth in one year)
- Proved business viability before full commitment

**Growth tactics:**

- Consistent product improvements
- Expanded feature set beyond deep links
- Introduced Team Licenses for recurring revenue
- Leveraged existing audience from blog and newsletter

**Result:** MRR grew from $1,126 (Jan 2023) to $4,512 (Jan 2024)

#### Phase 3: Full-time Indie (March 2024 - Present)

**Revenue: Six-figure annual revenue**

**Transition rationale:**

- Reached six-figure revenue milestone
- Low-risk transition with proven business
- Wanted to fulfill creativity and potential
- Still happy at WeTransfer, but felt constrained

**Post-transition activities:**

- Hired two team members for RocketSim Insights
- Launched first course: "From Side Project to Going Indie"
- Expanded product features (Network Monitoring, Network Link Conditioner)
- Focus on scaling and new initiatives

### Key Decisions

1. **Starting SwiftLee Blog (2015)**
   - **Why:** Build audience and establish expertise before launching products
   - **Result:** 60K Twitter followers, 19.5K newsletter subscribers, 140K+ monthly blog visits became distribution channel for RocketSim

2. **Building RocketSim for Own Needs (2019)**
   - **Why:** Solve personal pain point ensures product-market fit
   - **Result:** Created genuinely useful tool that other iOS developers needed

3. **Negotiating 4-Day Work Week (Jan 2023)**
   - **Why:** Test business viability without full risk of quitting
   - **Context:** WeTransfer was supportive, allowed gradual transition
   - **Result:** MRR grew 4x in one year, proving business sustainability

4. **Quitting Only After Six-Figure Revenue (Mar 2024)**
   - **Why:** Reduce financial risk, ensure business can support lifestyle
   - **Context:** 7.5 years at WeTransfer, strong reputation, could return to employment if needed
   - **Result:** Smooth transition without financial stress

5. **Hiring Team Members (2024)**
   - **Why:** Scale operations and build RocketSim Insights
   - **Result:** Expanded capabilities beyond solo developer limitations

### Pivots & Changes

- **From Blog to Products (2015 → 2019):** Shifted from pure content creation to building monetizable products while maintaining blog
- **From Deep Links Tool to Comprehensive Developer Tool:** RocketSim evolved from single-purpose utility to Apple-recommended "Essential Developer Tool" with multiple features
- **From Solo to Team:** Expanded from solo operation to 3-person team in 2024

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "One dedicated day per week on side projects can accelerate growth exponentially"

Context: Discussing the impact of the 4-day work week arrangement. MRR grew 4x in one year when dedicating just one day per week.

> "Building in public and maintaining consistent content creates audience trust"

Context: Explaining how 9 years of weekly blog posts built the audience that became RocketSim's customer base.

> "Solving your own problems creates market-validated products"

Context: RocketSim started as a tool for his own deep link testing needs. If he needed it, other iOS developers did too.

- Reaching financial sustainability through side projects reduces transition risk
- Audience growth compounds when you balance quality with consistency
- Not entirely fulfilling creativity and potential even when happy at current job
- Six-figure revenue made the transition low-risk and stress-free

### What They Say Didn't Work

Antoine didn't explicitly mention failures in the source material, but implied lessons:

- Trying to rush the transition would have been premature (waited 9 years from blog start)
- Quitting before reaching financial milestone would have been risky
- Building product without audience would have been harder (audience-first approach crucial)

### Their Advice to Others

> "One dedicated day per week on side projects can accelerate growth exponentially"

Context: Advice for people considering indie transition while employed. Negotiate reduced hours if possible.

- Build audience first, products second
- Solve your own problems to ensure product-market fit
- Wait for clear financial milestone before quitting
- Use 4-day work week as transition strategy if possible
- Consistency compounds over years
- Six-figure revenue provides sustainable lifestyle for indie developer
