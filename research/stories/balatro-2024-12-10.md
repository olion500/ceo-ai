## The Story

### Problem Discovery

LocalThunk was an IT worker in Saskatchewan, Canada, who had been making hobby games for years but never released anything commercially or publicly—only sharing games with friends and family.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, LocalThunk wanted to create an online version of **Big Two** (a Cantonese card shedding game) for friends to play together remotely. The project evolved as he experimented with card game mechanics and roguelike progression systems.

Inspired by:
- **Big Two**: Card game from his youth
- **Luck Be a Landlord**: Roguelike deck-builder that inspired progression mechanics
- **Slay the Spire**: Roguelike structure (though he didn't play it until mid-development)

**Key insight:** LocalThunk realized poker hands could be the foundation for a roguelike scoring system, even though **he doesn't actually play poker**.

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** December 2021 - February 2024 (2.5 years)

**Development Environment:**
- **Started:** December 13, 2021 (folder named "template" in Lua learning directory)
- **Engine:** LÖVE framework (Lua)
- **Primary work:** Evenings and weekends while working full-time IT job
- **Location:** Home in Saskatchewan, Canada (cold winters = indoor dev time)

**Initial Development Phase (December 2021):**
- First attempt: Online multiplayer "Big Cheat" game
- Within first week: Pivoted to what became Balatro
- December 20, 2021: "CardGame" folder created (permanent project directory)
- End of December 2021: Core **CHIP × MULT mechanic** established, card enhancement system working
- No Jokers or blind selection yet in initial prototype

**Key Innovation:**
- **Poker hands** as scoring foundation
- **Jokers** as modifier cards (added February 2022)
- **Chips × Multiplier** scoring system
- **Roguelike run structure** with escalating blind targets
- **Deck manipulation** mechanics (enhancing, destroying cards)

**Development Rhythm:**
- **Year 1 (2022)**: Hobby project, evenings/weekends, full-time IT job
- **Vacation time**: December 2021 used banked vacation (entire month off)
- **March 2022**: Paused to avoid burnout
- **May 2022**: Resumed with renewed excitement
- **January 2023**: Quit IT job to dev full-time (partner got job in different province)

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision: Pivot from Big Two multiplayer to solo roguelike**
   - **Why:** Original multiplayer idea not working, single-player roguelike more manageable
   - **Result:** Found the right format for the concept

2. **Decision: Use poker hands despite not playing poker**
   - **Why:** Recognized widespread familiarity with poker hands as scoring system
   - **Result:** Accessible to broad audience, "poker roguelike" is clear hook

3. **Decision: Continue development after friend's positive feedback**
   - **Why:** First time ever receiving "20-40 hours played" feedback from friend
   - **Result:** Validated the game's addictive potential

4. **Decision: Quit IT job in January 2023**
   - **Why:** Partner got job elsewhere, had savings, wanted full-time focus
   - **Result:** Able to polish and prepare for successful launch

5. **Decision: Sign with Playstack publisher**
   - **Why:** Needed help with porting, marketing, console releases
   - **Result:** Multi-platform launch, professional marketing support

6. **Decision: Participate in Next Fest (October 2023)**
   - **Why:** Major visibility opportunity on Steam
   - **Result:** Wishlists jumped from 49K to 77K in one month

7. **Decision: Price at $14.99**
   - **Why:** Premium indie pricing reflecting game's depth and quality
   - **Result:** Strong revenue per sale while remaining accessible

8. **Decision: Launch with review embargo day before release**
   - **Why:** Build anticipation, ensure day-1 awareness
   - **Result:** 90+ Metacritic scores built hype for launch day

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Burnout in March 2022
   - **Solution:** Took break, resumed in May when excited again
   - **Result:** Sustained long-term development without quitting

2. **Challenge:** Never released anything commercially before
   - **Solution:** Signed with experienced publisher (Playstack)
   - **Result:** Professional guidance through launch process

3. **Challenge:** Severe anxiety attack in January 2024 pre-launch
   - **Solution:** Sought medical care, leaned on community testers
   - **Result:** Successfully managed pressure, delivered quality launch

4. **Challenge:** Working full-time IT job while developing
   - **Solution:** Used banked vacation time, evenings/weekends, eventually quit
   - **Result:** Completed development while maintaining income until ready

5. **Challenge:** Initial low wishlist count (48 in May 2023)
   - **Solution:** Publisher help, Next Fest, streamer organic coverage
   - **Result:** Grew to 114K wishlists by launch

6. **Challenge:** Expectations management (expected "maybe 10 copies")
   - **Solution:** Focused on making great game, not predicting success
   - **Result:** Under-promised, massively over-delivered

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What LocalThunk Said

> "I don't play poker at all"

Context: Game is poker-themed but creator doesn't play poker—focused on poker as familiar scoring system.

> "I was expecting to sell maybe 10 copies" and thought he'd "be lucky to shift a tiny fraction of that figure, and was expecting to go back to his previous career in IT"

Context: Zero expectations helped avoid pressure, made success more meaningful.

> "In all his years of sharing projects with friends he had never received feedback like that [20-40 hours played], and it really pushed him over the edge to fully flesh out this idea"

Context: Friend's extreme engagement validated game's addictive potential.

> "The numbers on that page made no sense" when seeing 50,000 copies sold on launch day

Context: Developer's amazement at success far exceeding expectations.

> Described launch day as "the most surreal" of his life

Context: From IT worker to game industry phenomenon in single day.
