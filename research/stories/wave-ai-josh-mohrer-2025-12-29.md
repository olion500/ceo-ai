# Wave AI Note Taker Success Story - Josh Mohrer

## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Josh Mohrer, former General Manager of Uber New York, identified a universal pain point: **sifting through lengthy audio recordings** from meetings, calls, and lectures. The manual effort of reviewing recordings wasted significant time for professionals and teams.

**Key Insights:**
- Professionals record important conversations but rarely review them fully
- Manual transcription expensive and time-consuming
- AI transcription alone insufficient without summarization
- Mobile-first approach needed (capture anywhere, not just at desk)
- "Capturing life's important moments outside of a desk setting"

**Unique Positioning:**
- **Former Uber NYC Director perspective:** Understood high-volume professional communication
- **Non-technical founder:** Leveraged AI tools (ChatGPT) to build despite no coding background
- **Solo founder timing:** AI made solo development of complex apps newly feasible
- **Mobile-first focus:** Record conversations on-the-go, not tethered to desktop

### MVP Development
