# Harvey Legal AI Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Winston Weinberg was a first-year securities and antitrust litigator at O'Melveny & Myers, a major law firm. Gabriel Pereyra was an AI research scientist at DeepMind, Google Brain, and Meta AI. The two were roommates and best friends in San Diego, never expecting to start a company together.

**The Pivotal Moment (Early 2022):**

Pereyra showed Weinberg OpenAI's GPT-3. Weinberg was "stunned" by the model's capabilities and realized there was a massive gap: powerful AI existed, but no one was building real-world applications for complex professional workflows.

**The Legal Use Case Discovery:**

Weinberg was assigned a landlord-tenant case at O'Melveny, despite having no prior expertise in that area. He and Pereyra began experimenting with GPT-3 using chain-of-thought prompting over California statutes—before this technique became mainstream.

**Key Insight:**
> "Why don't you build a legal assistant?" - Winston Weinberg to Gabriel Pereyra

This simple suggestion became the foundation of Harvey.

**Validation Methodology:**

The founders didn't just assume lawyers would accept AI. They built a rigorous test:

1. Grabbed 100 questions from r/legaladvice on Reddit
2. Ran their chain-of-thought prompts over them
3. Gave the AI-generated answers to three landlord-tenant attorneys **without mentioning AI**
4. Asked if they would send the responses to clients with zero edits

**Results:**

**The Cold Email That Changed Everything:**

On July 4th morning at 10 a.m., the founders emailed Sam Altman and Jason Kwon (OpenAI's general counsel) with their pitch.

Result: "We got on a call with them and kind of the rest of the C-suite" the same day.

OpenAI's Startup Fund became their first institutional investor, and they were introduced to angel investors Sarah Guo and Elad Gil.

**Initial Product Approach:**

Rather than building from scratch, Harvey partnered with OpenAI to co-develop **custom legal models**. This strategic decision allowed them to:

- Launch faster by leveraging existing LLM infrastructure
- Focus on legal domain expertise and workflows
- Achieve superior performance through custom fine-tuning

**First Product: Harvey Assistant**

Core features:

- Domain-aware AI supporting 50+ languages/jurisdictions
- **Assist Mode**: Analysis and summarization
- **Draft Mode**: Substantive document creation
- Microsoft Word integration

**Tech Stack:**

- Custom fine-tuned legal LLMs (partnership with OpenAI)
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
- Orchestration engines (including OpenAI's o1 model)
- Enterprise security infrastructure
- Multi-jurisdictional data residency (60+ countries)

**Development Philosophy:**

- Build for legal professionals, not generic users
- Hire actual lawyers to design products
- Prioritize accuracy and citations over speed
- Address hallucination problem proactively

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Direct outreach to BigLaw firms (no public launch event)
**Date:** November 2022

**Pre-launch:**

- Secured OpenAI Startup Fund investment ($5M Seed)
- Built relationships with top-tier law firms
- Recruited attorneys from elite firms for product development

**Launch Approach:**

The team used a creative, personalized strategy:

1. **Accessed PACER** (Public Access to Court Electronic Records)
2. **Identified partners** who authored recent litigation briefs
3. **Demonstrated Harvey** using their own work
4. **Showed counter-arguments** Harvey could construct to their previous briefs

This approach was devastatingly effective because:

- It addressed recent work attorneys had just completed
- Proved Harvey understood their specific practice area
- Generated immediate credibility and interest

**First Major Customer: Allen & Overy (Early 2023)**

Allen & Overy, one of the world's largest law firms with 3,500 attorneys, became Harvey's first major customer. They announced they were rolling out Harvey to all attorneys.

Major hurdle: Preventing firms from accidentally sharing confidential information between different client matters.

> "If you're working on a deal for Sequoia, but also working on another deal for Kleiner Perkins, what happens if you accidentally give all the data on the Sequoia deal to Kleiner Perkins? Huge, astronomical problem." - Winston Weinberg

Solution: Sophisticated access controls, data isolation, and compliance infrastructure.

**Funding Milestones:**

**Customer Penetration:**

- 700+ clients across 63 countries
- Majority of top 10 US law firms

#### Phase 4: Current State & Future (Late 2025+)

**Primary Use Cases (Ranked by Adoption):**

   - Fund formation documents
   - Contract drafting and revision

2. **Research** (Growing with LexisNexis partnership)
   - Case law research
   - Statute interpretation
   - Regulatory compliance

Future: Transitioning to outcome-based pricing for:

- Repetitive, high-accuracy tasks
- Where AI reliability exceeds human performance
- Maintains attorney involvement for complex judgment work

**Market Opportunity:**

> "8-9 million lawyers globally, Harvey's current penetration remains minimal. More significantly, the industry has barely begun utilizing these systems for complex, high-value work." - Winston Weinberg

Example: "Legal fees for a merger could easily be tens of millions of dollars" yet current AI capabilities remain insufficient for most complex work.

**Vision for Junior Lawyers:**

> "If you can build tools that can do the first pass of an M&A, that is a one-on-one tutor for a junior associate." - Winston Weinberg

Weinberg envisions Harvey as an educational accelerator:

- Real-time feedback on legal work
- Faster learning curve for juniors
- Transform legal education and training

**Fundraising Philosophy:**

> "The best way to raise money is to just make sure your company is doing super well. Spend 99% of time building the business, then identify a few aligned long-term partners."

No immediate plans for large fundraising rounds. Expressed interest in eventual public markets, but no timeline disclosed.

**Context:** On building domain-specific AI. Advice to founders: evaluation is harder than generation.

**Implied Advice (from tactics):**

1. **Validate rigorously before building** - Test with real professionals, don't assume
2. **Cold email works** - Even top executives (Sam Altman) respond to good pitches
3. **Personalize at scale** - Use public data (PACER) to make demos hyper-relevant
4. **Hire domain experts** - 50% of team should understand the domain deeply
5. **Premium positioning is viable** - Don't default to freemium, high-value customers exist
6. **Move fast in AI boom** - "Every six months" you'll face new scaling challenges
7. **Partner with the best** - Don't reinvent the wheel (OpenAI partnership vs building LLMs)
8. **Land-and-expand in enterprise** - Patience pays off with high net revenue retention
