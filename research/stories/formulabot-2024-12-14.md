# FormulaBot Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

David Bressler identified a pain point many Excel and Google Sheets users face: **writing complex formulas**. Instead of memorizing syntax or searching through documentation, users wanted a simple way to describe what they needed in plain English and get the formula automatically.
