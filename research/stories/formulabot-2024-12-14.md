## The Story

### Problem Discovery

David Bressler identified a pain point many Excel and Google Sheets users face: **writing complex formulas**. Instead of memorizing syntax or searching through documentation, users wanted a simple way to describe what they needed in plain English and get the formula automatically.

**Market Validation:**
- **750 million Excel users worldwide** represent a massive addressable market
- People struggle with formula syntax daily
- Existing solutions required manual searching and learning

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** August 28, 2022 launch

**Tech Stack:**
- **Bubble** (no-code platform) - entire app built without traditional coding
- **OpenAI API** (GPT models) - formula generation engine
- **Sendinblue/Brevo** - email marketing
- **Stripe** - payment processing

**Development Approach:**
Before building the complete product, Bressler **validated demand through Reddit**. He shared his tool concept on Reddit, which got **over 10,000 upvotes** and drove **81,000 website visitors**, confirming massive market interest before full development.

**Why This Worked:**
Low operational costs because **"formulas require very little text and ChatGPT tokens"** - the core product has minimal API costs compared to other AI applications.
