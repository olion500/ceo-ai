# HabitKit Success Story - Sebastian Röhl


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Sebastian identified the need for a better habit tracking app through personal experience and market research. The habit tracking category has proven demand, but existing solutions had gaps in features and user experience.

**Key insights:**

- Habit tracking is a proven category with consistent demand
- New Year's resolutions create predictable seasonal spikes
- Users want flexible tracking with categories, widgets, and multiple views
- Mobile-first approach essential for daily habit tracking

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** Before 2022 (exact timeline not disclosed in source)

**Initial Features:**

- Basic habit tracking
- Streak counting
- Simple interface

**Tech Stack:**

- Cross-platform approach with native implementations

**Development Process:**

- Solo developer building nights and weekends initially
- Focused on core habit tracking functionality first
- Iterative improvements based on user feedback

**Costs:**

- Standard app development costs (Apple Developer Program, hosting, tools)
- Time investment as primary cost

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** App Store (iOS primary), likely Google Play for Android

**Pre-launch:**

- Not detailed in source, likely soft launch with beta testing

**Launch Results:**

- Initial traction in habit tracking category
- Steady growth with seasonal spikes around New Year

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: First Full-time Attempt (April 2022 - April 2023)

**Status: Returned to Employment**

**What happened:**

- Quit software engineering job in April 2022
- Revenue insufficient to sustain full-time indie work
- Financial pressure led to returning to employment in April 2023

**Lessons learned:**

- Quitting too early without sufficient revenue was premature
- Need larger financial runway for indie sustainability
- Solo developer capacity constraints limit growth speed

#### Phase 2: Part-time with Employment (April 2023 - February 2024)

**Revenue growth observed but not quantified**

**Key activities:**

- Continued building HabitKit while employed
- Observed strong growth during 2023 holiday season
- Planned major features for future release
- Built confidence in product's potential

**Critical insight:** Holiday season 2023 showed strong revenue potential, giving confidence for second quit attempt

#### Phase 3: Second Full-time Attempt (February 2024 - Present)

**Revenue: $0 → $10,000 MRR**

**February 1, 2024:** Quit job for second time

**Goal set:** $10,000 MRR by end of year

**Mid-year challenge:**

- Growth plateau
- Struggled with productivity as solo full-time indie
- Anxiety about revenue sustainability
- Difficulty maintaining discipline without external structure

**Major turning points:**

**June 2024: Times Square Billboard**

- Won RevenueCat contest
- Featured in NYC Times Square
- Learning: High-profile exposure doesn't guarantee conversions

**December 2024: MKBHD Feature**

- Appeared in "The Studio" YouTube channel video
- Editor discovered Sebastian organically on Threads (no outreach)

**Year-end result:** Achieved exactly $10,000 MRR goal

### Key Decisions

1. **First Quit Attempt (April 2022)**
   - **Why:** Wanted to pursue indie development full-time
   - **Result:** Revenue insufficient, returned to employment after one year
   - **Lesson:** Timing was premature, needed more revenue first

2. **Returning to Employment (April 2023)**
   - **Why:** Financial necessity, revenue couldn't sustain lifestyle
   - **Result:** Continued building part-time, gained financial stability
   - **Lesson:** Sometimes stepping back is necessary for long-term success

3. **Second Quit Attempt (February 2024)**
   - **Why:** Strong holiday 2023 growth showed potential
   - **Context:** More confident about revenue trajectory
   - **Result:** Achieved $10K MRR goal by year end
   - **Lesson:** Better timing with stronger revenue foundation

4. **Halting Other Projects Mid-2024**
   - **Why:** Solo developer capacity constraints
   - **Context:** Started Flutter boilerplate and new app, realized spreading too thin
   - **Result:** Focused exclusively on HabitKit, achieved goals
   - **Lesson:** Focus > diversification for solo developers

5. **Pricing Experimentation Throughout 2024**
   - **Why:** Searching for optimal price point
   - **Context:** "I still haven't found the best pricing point"
   - **Result:** Ongoing optimization, no perfect answer yet
   - **Lesson:** Pricing is continuous experiment, not one-time decision

   - **Solution:** Stopped other projects (Flutter boilerplate, new app), focused exclusively on HabitKit
   - **Result:** Achieved $10K MRR goal by focusing

5. **Challenge:** Goal-setting and anxiety

   - **Result:** Set "modest goals" for 2025, learned from overly ambitious 2024 targets

6. **Challenge:** Newsletter growth

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "My most successful month since I started the business"

Context: Describing December 2024 after MKBHD feature. Organic discovery by influential creator drove massive growth.

- MKBHD feature had far more impact than Times Square billboard
- Organic social media presence (Threads) can lead to unexpected opportunities
- Focusing exclusively on one product (HabitKit) better than spreading across multiple projects
- Extended success "makes you more chill" about revenue fluctuations
- Patience during mid-year plateau paid off in H2

### What They Say Didn't Work

> "In terms of downloads and revenue, this wasn't a huge success"

Context: Times Square billboard from RevenueCat contest. High visibility doesn't guarantee conversions.

> "I still haven't found the best pricing point"

Context: Ongoing pricing experimentation shows there's no perfect answer, continuous optimization required.

> "barely completed half" [of goal list]

Context: 2024 goal setting. Overly ambitious targets create stress rather than motivation.

- Quitting too early (2022) without sufficient revenue foundation
- Times Square billboard (visibility ≠ conversions)
- Overly ambitious goal lists create stress
- Not regularly reviewing goals caused anxiety

### Their Advice to Others

> "It's easy to get miserable and be distracted as a full-time indie hacker"

Context: Reflecting on challenges of solo full-time work. Self-discipline without external structure is difficult.

**For 2025:**

- Set "modest goals" intentionally scaled back
- Focus on requested features rather than new projects
- Plan major improvements around New Year's resolution timing

## Research Metadata

**Research Quality:** High

**Research Process:**

  - "Sebastian Roehl HabitKit 2024 review"
  - "side project $10K MRR 2024"

**Missing Information:**

- [ ] Exact user/customer numbers
- [ ] Detailed first quit attempt timeline (2022-2023)
- [ ] Specific pricing tiers and amounts
- [ ] Conversion rates and retention metrics
- [ ] Exact revenue progression month-by-month
- [ ] Backend technology and infrastructure details

**Researcher Notes:**
This case study is particularly valuable for understanding:

1. **Failed First Attempt:** Rare transparency about quitting too early (2022) and having to return to employment
2. **Timing Matters:** Second quit (2024) successful because of stronger revenue foundation
3. **Marketing Insights:** Times Square billboard failed, MKBHD organic discovery succeeded massively
4. **Solo Developer Challenges:** Productivity, discipline, capacity constraints clearly articulated
5. **Goal Setting:** Honest about overly ambitious goals causing stress

The story shows that "failure" (returning to employment) can be strategic step toward ultimate success.

**Validation Status:**

- [x] $10K MRR milestone realistic for mobile subscription app
- [x] Timeline makes sense (2+ years to $10K MRR)
- [x] Founder identity confirmed via Substack and social media
- [x] Product appears active (ongoing development)
- [x] MKBHD feature verifiable (December 2024 "The Studio" episode)

**Follow-up Opportunities:**

- Monitor 2025 progress toward "modest goals"
- Track New Year's 2025 revenue spike (predictable seasonal pattern)
- Follow implementation of requested features (inverse habits, searchable icons, etc.)
- Watch for pricing experimentation results
- Check if focus-only strategy continues or new projects emerge
