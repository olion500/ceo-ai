# HabitKit Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Personal Burnout Led to Solution:**
Sebastian Röhl experienced burnout as a software engineer in early 2022. He decided to pursue his dream of building a profitable app business, giving himself 12 months to achieve financial independence through app development.

**Initial Problem:**
- Needed habit tracking for personal productivity
- Existing apps were either too complex or lacked key features
- As a developer, saw opportunity to build better solution

**Key Insight:**
- Habit tracking apps have natural retention (people use daily)
- New Year's resolutions create January spike in downloads
- Cross-platform (iOS + Android) expands market

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** ~2-3 months (Sept-Nov 2022)

**Initial Features:**
- Basic habit tracking (daily check-ins)
- Streak counting
- Simple iOS interface
- Cloud sync (for user data)

**Tech Stack:**
- iOS: Swift, SwiftUI
- Android: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose
- Backend: Not disclosed (likely Firebase or similar)
- Cross-platform development

**Development Process:**
- First app (LiftBear) launched in early 2022 - failed
- Learned from failure, pivoted to HabitKit
- Launched November 2022
- Immediate traction unlike previous app

**Initial Investment:** Solo developer time, no external funding

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Apple App Store, Google Play Store

**Pre-launch:**
- Minimal marketing
- Focus on product quality
- Built as personal tool first

**Launch Results:**
- Immediate revenue generation (unlike LiftBear)
- Early app store ranking
- Organic discovery through App Store search

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Launch & Early Validation (Nov 2022 - Apr 2023)

#### Phase 2: Traction Discovery (May 2023 - Dec 2023)

#### Phase 3: Full-Time Commitment (Feb 2024 - June 2024)
  - Required learning Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Swift, SwiftUI
  - Made interactive widgets for both iOS and Android platforms

#### Phase 4: Breakthrough & Scale (Summer 2024 - Present)

### Key Decisions

1. **Return to Work (April 2023)**
   - **Why:** Revenue insufficient to sustain, needed runway
   - **Result:** Built financial cushion, reduced stress, allowed patience

2. **Quit Job Again (February 2024)**
   - **Why:** Opportunity too promising after 18 months of growth
   - **Result:** "Best decision I've made in my life so far" - full focus on product

3. **Focus on HabitKit Only (Fall 2024)**
   - **Why:** "Limited time and can't tackle multiple new projects at once"
   - **Result:** Halted Flutter boilerplate and new app development
   - **Trade-off:** Abandoned potential revenue sources for core product quality

4. **Interactive Widgets Priority (Summer 2024)**
   - **Why:** Most requested feature from users
   - **Result:** Months of development, required learning new frameworks
   - **Impact:** Differentiation from competitors

5. **Pricing Experimentation**
   - **Why:** "One of the most influential decisions"
   - **Result:** Still searching for optimal pricing (ongoing)

   - **Outcome:** "Best decision I've made in my life," hit $10K MRR

3. **Decision: Focus Only on HabitKit (Fall 2024)**
