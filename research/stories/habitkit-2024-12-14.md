## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Personal Burnout Led to Solution:**
Sebastian Röhl experienced burnout as a software engineer in early 2022. He decided to pursue his dream of building a profitable app business, giving himself 12 months to achieve financial independence through app development.

**Initial Problem:**
- Needed habit tracking for personal productivity
- Existing apps were either too complex or lacked key features
- As a developer, saw opportunity to build better solution

**Key Insight:**
- Habit tracking apps have natural retention (people use daily)
- New Year's resolutions create January spike in downloads
- Cross-platform (iOS + Android) expands market

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** ~2-3 months (Sept-Nov 2022)

**Initial Features:**
- Basic habit tracking (daily check-ins)
- Streak counting
- Simple iOS interface
- Cloud sync (for user data)

**Tech Stack:**
- iOS: Swift, SwiftUI
- Android: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose
- Backend: Not disclosed (likely Firebase or similar)
- Cross-platform development

**Development Process:**
- First app (LiftBear) launched in early 2022 - failed
- Learned from failure, pivoted to HabitKit
- Launched November 2022
- Immediate traction unlike previous app

**Initial Investment:** Solo developer time, no external funding

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Apple App Store, Google Play Store

**Pre-launch:**
- Minimal marketing
- Focus on product quality
- Built as personal tool first

**Launch Results:**
- Immediate revenue generation (unlike LiftBear)
- Early app store ranking
- Organic discovery through App Store search

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Launch & Early Validation (Nov 2022 - Apr 2023)
- **Nov 2022:** Launched HabitKit, first revenue
- **Dec 2022-Jan 2023:** Christmas/New Year rush showed potential
- **Feb 2023:** Revenue insufficient, returned to engineering work (4 days/week)
- **Apr 2023:** Worked on apps part-time while employed

#### Phase 2: Traction Discovery (May 2023 - Dec 2023)
- **May 2023:** HabitKit began ranking on app stores, revenue spiked
- **Dec 2023/Jan 2024:** Strong Christmas rush demonstrated opportunity
- **Realization:** Too promising to ignore, needed full-time focus

#### Phase 3: Full-Time Commitment (Feb 2024 - June 2024)
- **Feb 2024:** Quit job again to work full-time on apps
- **Summer 2024:** Developed most challenging feature: home screen widgets
  - Required learning Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Swift, SwiftUI
  - Made interactive widgets for both iOS and Android platforms
- **June 2024:** Won RevenueCat's Times Square billboard contest

#### Phase 4: Breakthrough & Scale (Summer 2024 - Present)
- **Fall 2024:** Tough decision - halted other projects to focus on HabitKit
- **Dec 2024:** Featured in MKBHD video, described as "most successful month since I started"
- **Achievement:** Reached $10,000 MRR milestone (2024 goal)

### Key Decisions

1. **Return to Work (April 2023)**
   - **Why:** Revenue insufficient to sustain, needed runway
   - **Result:** Built financial cushion, reduced stress, allowed patience

2. **Quit Job Again (February 2024)**
   - **Why:** Opportunity too promising after 18 months of growth
   - **Result:** "Best decision I've made in my life so far" - full focus on product

3. **Focus on HabitKit Only (Fall 2024)**
   - **Why:** "Limited time and can't tackle multiple new projects at once"
   - **Result:** Halted Flutter boilerplate and new app development
   - **Trade-off:** Abandoned potential revenue sources for core product quality

4. **Interactive Widgets Priority (Summer 2024)**
   - **Why:** Most requested feature from users
   - **Result:** Months of development, required learning new frameworks
   - **Impact:** Differentiation from competitors

5. **Pricing Experimentation**
   - **Why:** "One of the most influential decisions"
   - **Result:** Still searching for optimal pricing (ongoing)

### Pivots & Changes

- **Product Focus:** Multiple apps → HabitKit-only (Fall 2024)
- **Work Mode:** Full-time → Part-time (Apr 2023) → Full-time again (Feb 2024)
- **Feature Priority:** Founder-driven → User-requested (categories, widgets, view modes)

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** Organic App Store Discovery
- **How:** ASO (App Store Optimization) strategy
- **Performance:** Consistent rankings in productivity category
- **Tactics:** Keyword optimization, screenshots, reviews

**Secondary Channels:**

1. **Content Marketing**
   - 42+ blog articles published
   - Most successful: "Must-Have Tools for Indie App Development" and "App Store Optimization Strategy"
   - 14,000+ social media followers
   - 400+ newsletter subscribers

2. **PR & Media**
   - RevenueCat Times Square billboard: "Wasn't a huge success" in downloads/revenue

3. **Social Media**
   - Active on Threads (where MKBHD editor discovered)
   - Newsletter: 400+ subscribers
   - Twitter/X: Part of 14K+ social following

**Failed Attempts:**
- Times Square billboard: High visibility, low conversion
- Many projects abandoned: Flutter boilerplate, WinDiary expansion

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Subscription-based (specific tiers not disclosed)

**Pricing Evolution:**
- Ongoing experimentation
- Identified as "most influential decision"
- Still optimizing for conversion vs. revenue

**App Portfolio Revenue:**
- **HabitKit:** Primary revenue driver (~90%+)
- **LiftBear:** Fitness app, failed to gain traction
- **WinDiary:** Launched 2023, unclear status

**Conversion Funnel:**
- Free download → Free trial → Paid subscription
- January spike: New Year's resolutions drive downloads

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** First app (LiftBear) saw no meaningful traction
   - **Solution:** Launched HabitKit, better product-market fit
   - **Result:** Immediate validation with revenue

2. **Challenge:** Insufficient revenue in 2023
   - **Solution:** Returned to engineering work part-time
   - **Result:** Financial runway, reduced stress, enabled patience

3. **Challenge:** Cross-platform development complexity
   - **Solution:** Learned Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Swift, SwiftUI
   - **Result:** Interactive widgets on both platforms, competitive advantage

4. **Challenge:** Limited resources as solo developer
   - **Solution:** Focus decision - halted all other projects
   - **Result:** Higher quality core product

5. **Challenge:** Productivity and discipline as full-time indie hacker
   - **Solution:** "Need to be disciplined to make it work"
   - **Result:** Ongoing challenge, requires conscious effort

6. **Challenge:** Anxiety about app success
