## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Original Vision (2013):**
Ivan Zhao wanted "to give anyone the ability to customize software to their needs"

**Inspiration:**

- Computing pioneers: Alan Kay, Ted Nelson
- Belief: Everyone could be a creator
- Goal: Let users design their own tools

**Initial Product:**

- Web page builder for creating custom apps
- Complex app-building platform
- Highly customizable, flexible system

**The Reality Check:**
> "Most people weren't interested in building their own software; instead, they simply wanted a tool to help them with their tasks."

**Key Insight:**

- Original product was "what I wanted" not what users needed
- Platform was buggy, overly complex
- Failed to gain traction
- Users wanted productivity, not programming

### The Repositioning Strategy

**From:** Web app builder / Custom software platform
**To:** All-in-one workspace for productivity

**The Crisis (2014-2015):**

- First version flopped completely
- Company nearly collapsed
- Exhausted funds and ideas
- Faced complete shutdown

**The Kyoto Pivot:**

- Drastic decision: Scrap everything
- Laid off small team
- Moved from San Francisco to Kyoto (lower costs)
- Complete rebuild from scratch
- Coded intensively for months
- **Not incremental improvement—complete philosophical reset**

**Core Repositioning Insight:**
> "Sugar-coating the broccoli" — Start with familiar use case (documents/notes), then gradually introduce advanced features

**How They Changed the Frame:**

1. **Solve Real Problems First:**
   - Familiar use cases (notes, docs, wikis)
   - Real user problems, not theoretical ones

2. **Hide Complexity:**
   - Advanced customization available
   - But not forced on users
   - Progressive disclosure

3. **Build for the World, Not Ourselves:**
   - Incorporated direct user feedback
   - Dramatically simplified experience
   - Made it accessible to non-technical users

4. **Community as Strategy:**
   - Ivan personally replied to user tweets/emails
   - Created grassroots advocacy
   - Built trust before monetization

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 2015 rebuild in Kyoto (months of intensive coding)

**Philosophical Reset:**

- Not abandoning vision, but repackaging it
- Started with what users understood
- Gradually revealed power-user features

**Initial Features (Post-Rebuild):**

- Customizable database views (innovation)
- Different people see same info different ways

**Tech Stack:**

- Not disclosed in detail
- Web-based platform
- Real-time collaboration

**Development Process:**

- Scrapped entire original codebase
- Complete rebuild in Kyoto
- User feedback-driven

- Enabled faster decision-making
- High output per employee

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision: Scrap everything and rebuild (2015)**
   - **Why:** First version completely failed
   - **Reasoning:** Incremental fixes wouldn't work, needed complete reset
   - **Result:** Successful relaunch, found product-market fit

2. **Decision: "Sugar-coat the broccoli" (hide complexity)**
   - **Why:** Users didn't want app-building, they wanted productivity
   - **Reasoning:** Start familiar, reveal power gradually
   - **Result:** Non-technical users adopted, power users stayed

3. **Decision: Delay monetization, generous free tier**
   - **Why:** Build trust before extracting value
   - **Reasoning:** Users need to experience value first
   - **Result:** When paid tiers launched, users willingly converted

4. **Decision: Stay lean (dozens of employees at $10B)**
   - **Why:** Speed and agility over scale
   - **Reasoning:** Smaller team = faster decisions, less bureaucracy
   - **Result:** Unicorn status with exceptional efficiency

5. **Decision: Community-first growth (founder engagement)**
   - **Why:** Grassroots advocacy more powerful than paid marketing
   - **Reasoning:** Personal touch builds loyal advocates
   - **Result:** Word-of-mouth drove growth, low CAC

6. **Decision: Horizontal product (many use cases)**
   - **Why:** Maximize addressable market
   - **Reasoning:** One tool replacing many = higher value
   - **Result:** Broad adoption across different user types

### Pivots & Changes

**Major Pivot: 2015 Complete Rebuild**

- **From:** App-building platform
- **To:** All-in-one productivity workspace

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "Sugar-coating the broccoli" — Start with a familiar use case (documents and notes), then gradually introduce advanced customization features once users understood the core value.
>
> "Built for 'the world, not just ourselves'"
- **Context:** Original product was "what I wanted" not what users needed

**On Horizontal Products:**

- Ivan personally replied to user tweets and emails early on
- Created grassroots advocacy before paid marketing

**On Staying Lean:**

- Reached unicorn status with just dozens of employees

- High output per person

**Key Success Factors:**

- Community as strategy (not just marketing)

- Craft and aesthetic sensibility
- Staying lean enables agility

### What They Say Didn't Work

**Original Product (2013-2015):**

- "What I wanted rather than what users actually needed"
- Too focused on theoretical vision vs practical problems

**Lessons from Failure:**

- Users don't want to build apps, they want productivity
- Complexity must be hidden, not forced
- Vision needs accessible abstraction layer

### Their Advice to Others

- "Sugar-coat" complexity with familiar use cases
- Build for users, not yourself

**On Growth:**

- Community > paid marketing
- Personal engagement builds advocacy
- Let users experience value before charging

**On Horizontal Products:**

- Provide both "bricks" and "boxes"
- Different users need different levels of guidance
- Templates showcase what's possible

**On Team:**

- Stay lean as long as possible
- Faster decisions > headcount
- Quality hires > quantity
