## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Origin Context:** Mofid Ansari founded Blinkstore.in, a self-hosted print-on-demand platform for India. While working at Blinkstore, Pranay Agarwal (who discovered passion for UI/UX design during college and became a freelancer) identified a critical gap in their workflow.

**Key Problem Identified (2021):**

- Existing mockup solutions were limited, slow, and typically required Photoshop knowledge
- This barrier prevented many potential print-on-demand sellers from creating professional mockups
- Blinkstore users needed quick, easy mockup generation without design expertise
- Browser-based solution could democratize mockup creation

**Insights:**

- Mockup generation was painful for non-designers
- Speed and ease-of-use more important than advanced features for most users
- Print-on-demand sellers needed mockups but couldn't afford designers
- AI could eventually enhance quality dramatically

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 2021 (approximately 2 months for initial version)

**Initial Features:**

- T-shirt mockups exclusively (started narrow)
- Browser-based mockup generation
- Design placement on mockups
- Color modification capabilities
- Fabric wrinkle simulation
- Initially integrated into Blinkstore platform

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **AI Integration:** Leveraged recent AI advances for high-quality image generation
- **Infrastructure:** Not specified, likely cloud hosting

**Development Process:**

- Built as nights-and-weekends project while both founders maintained full-time work
- Started with t-shirt mockups only (mastered fundamentals first)
- Spent ~2 months learning technical fundamentals: design placement, color modification, fabric wrinkle simulation
- Validated immediately with Blinkstore user spike in usage

**Initial Investment:**

- Founders forgoing salaries to reinvest in development
- Bootstrapped completely
- Time investment as primary cost

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Integrated with Blinkstore initially, then standalone

**Pre-launch:**

- Built for Blinkstore's existing user base (built-in initial audience)
- Leveraged Blinkstore's existing keyword rankings and SEO

**Launch Results:**

- **Immediate validation:** Usage spike after integrating into Blinkstore
- Organic growth from print-on-demand community
- Initial monetization through ads (~$700/month with 100K visitors)

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Nights and Weekends (2021 - December 2023)

**Revenue: $0 → $700/month (ads only)**

**Key Activities:**

- Built MVP during nights and weekends while both maintained employment
- Expanded from t-shirt mockups to broader mockup categories
- Invested heavily in SEO and content marketing
- Built Figma community file for free mockup generation with strategic CTAs
- Grew to ~100,000 monthly visitors

**Monetization:**

- Ads only: ~$700/month
- Free tier: Up to 3 mockups per day + ads throughout site
- No download limits yet (critical mistake)

**SEO Strategy Evolution:**

- Initially published tool reviews and AI news articles
- Google algorithm updates penalized this content
- **Pivot:** Focused exclusively on niche mockup-related keywords
- Lesson: High-volume, low-relevance keywords damage long-term authority

#### Phase 2: Full-time Transition (December 2023 - April 2024)

**Pranay's Decision to Quit**

**December 2023:** Pranay left his full-time position at a startup to focus exclusively on Mockey

**Why he quit:**

- Strong user growth (100K monthly visitors)
- Clear product-market fit validated
- Revenue from ads, but untapped subscription potential
- Co-founder (Mofid) still had Blinkstore income, reducing risk

**April 2024 - Critical Decision: Launch Subscriptions**

**Major Pivot:** Introduced paid subscriptions with download limits

**Implementation:**

- Free users: 3 mockups/day + ads
- Paid subscriptions: Unlimited downloads + no ads
- "You've reached your limit" message = psychological conversion trigger

**Result:** Revenue increased **3x immediately** after adding download limits

#### Phase 3: Scaling (April 2024 - Present)

**Revenue: $700/month → $12,000 MRR (17x growth in ~11 months)**

**Key Factors:**

- Subscription model with download limits = sustainable revenue
- Continued SEO focus on mockup-specific keywords
- Figma community file driving word-of-mouth growth
- AI-powered high-quality image generation
- Instant preview across multiple mockups simultaneously

**Current State (Early 2025):**

- $12,000 MRR
- ~100,000 monthly visitors
- Still completely bootstrapped
- Two-person team
- Target: $50,000 MRR by end of 2025

### Key Decisions

1. **Starting as Side Project (2021)**
   - **Why:** Reduce financial risk while validating idea
   - **Result:** Proved product-market fit before full commitment
   - **Lesson:** Nights and weekends allows safe experimentation

2. **Building for Blinkstore First (2021)**
   - **Why:** Had existing user base, understood pain point firsthand
   - **Context:** Mofid's Blinkstore provided initial distribution
   - **Result:** Immediate validation, built-in audience, SEO foundation
   - **Lesson:** Integrate into existing product before standalone launch

3. **Starting with T-Shirts Only (2021)**
   - **Why:** Master fundamentals before expanding
   - **Context:** Took 2 months to learn design placement, color modification, wrinkle simulation
   - **Result:** High-quality foundation, then expanded to other mockup types
   - **Lesson:** Go narrow to go deep, then expand

4. **Forgoing Salaries Initially (2021-2023)**
   - **Why:** Reinvest all revenue into product development
   - **Context:** Both founders had other income (employment/Blinkstore)
   - **Result:** Faster product development, maintained bootstrapped status
   - **Lesson:** Founders must have runway or side income for bootstrapping

5. **Pranay Quitting in December 2023**
   - **Why:** 100K monthly visitors, clear product-market fit, untapped subscription potential
   - **Context:** Co-founder still had Blinkstore income, reducing household risk
   - **Result:** Focused full-time development led to subscription launch in April 2024
   - **Lesson:** Quit when product-market fit clear, even if revenue not yet optimized

6. **SEO Pivot: Abandoning Tool Reviews (2023-2024)**
   - **Why:** Google algorithm updates penalized high-volume, low-relevance content
   - **Context:** Initially published tool reviews and AI news to drive traffic
   - **Result:** Narrowed to authentic mockup-related keywords, improved authority
   - **Lesson:** Quality, niche-specific keywords > high-volume generic keywords

7. **Adding Download Limits (April 2024)**
   - **Why:** Free unlimited downloads prevented conversion to paid
   - **Context:** Had 100K visitors but only $700/month revenue
   - **Result:** Revenue increased 3x immediately (to ~$2,100, then grew to $12K)
   - **Lesson:** "You've reached your limit" message = powerful conversion trigger

8. **Figma Community File Strategy (Ongoing)**
   - **Why:** Enable in-app mockup generation with CTAs directing to full platform
   - **Context:** Figma community huge distribution channel
   - **Result:** Exponential word-of-mouth growth
   - **Lesson:** Give away free tools on popular platforms with strategic CTAs

### Founder's Mindset & Decision-Making

**Initial Beliefs (2021):**

- Mockup problem worth solving (validated within Blinkstore)
- Browser-based > desktop software for accessibility
- Non-designers need simple tools, not Photoshop
- Nights and weekends safer than immediate full-time

## Research Metadata

**Research Quality:** High

- **Completeness:** 80% of template filled
- **Source Diversity:** 1 primary source (comprehensive Indie Hackers post)
- **First-hand Content:** 100% from founder directly
- **Data Recency:** Very current (early 2025)

**Research Process:**

- **Time Spent:** ~1 hour
- **Sources Reviewed:** 3
- **Sources Used:** 1 (comprehensive)
- **Search Queries Used:**
  - "Mockey.ai Pranay Agarwal $12k MRR"
  - "Indie Hackers Mockey AI mockup"

**Missing Information:**

- [ ] Exact user/customer counts
- [ ] Specific pricing tiers and amounts
- [ ] Conversion rates (free to paid)
- [ ] Retention and churn metrics
- [ ] Exact backend infrastructure details
- [ ] Mofid's role post-December 2023 (is he full-time on Mockey now?)
- [ ] Exact financial breakdown and profit margins

**Researcher Notes:**
This case study is particularly valuable for:

1. **Bootstrapped Co-Founder Approach:** Two founders, one quit full-time (Pranay December 2023), other had ongoing business (Blinkstore)
2. **Monetization Evolution:** 3 years ads-only before subscriptions shows patience, but also missed revenue
3. **Download Limits = 3x Revenue:** Powerful validation of freemium conversion tactics
4. **SEO Pivot:** Learned from Google penalties, focused niche keywords
5. **Platform Leverage:** Started within Blinkstore, expanded to Figma community
6. **Nights and Weekends for 3 Years:** Safe validation before full-time commitment

The story demonstrates successful nights-and-weekends → full-time transition with clear product-market fit validation before quitting.

**Validation Status:**

- [x] $12K MRR realistic for design SaaS with 100K visitors
- [x] 3x revenue increase after download limits aligns with freemium best practices
- [x] Timeline makes sense (2021 → 2025 = 4 years to $12K MRR)
- [x] Founders verified via Indie Hackers and Blinkstore website
- [x] Product active and findable at mockey.ai

**Follow-up Opportunities:**

- Monitor progress toward $50K MRR target (end of 2025)
- Track SEO strategy evolution and keyword rankings
- Follow Figma community file growth and impact
- Check if Mofid transitions to full-time on Mockey
- Watch for pricing tier reveals and optimization
- See if they expand beyond mockups into broader design tools
