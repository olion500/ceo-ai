# SiteGPT Success Story

## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Bhanu Teja was already running Feather, a Notion-powered blogging platform generating ~$4K MRR. When the AI boom hit in early 2023, he had a simple insight:

**The Problem:**
People wanted to interact with website content conversationally, not just read it. Every website had information locked in static pages, but no easy way to let visitors ask questions and get instant answers.

**The Insight:**
Rather than building this feature only for Feather users, he realized it could be a standalone product for any website owner.

**Validation:**
- AI chatbots were trending
- No dominant player in "train on your website" niche yet
- Simple, clear value proposition
- Technical feasibility with existing AI APIs

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks from idea to launch

**Initial Features:**
- Website content scraping/crawling
- AI training on website content
- Embeddable chat widget
- Simple dashboard for customization
- Pay-to-use model (no free tier)

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Remix (JavaScript/TypeScript framework)
- Deployment: Cloudflare Workers
- Database: Fauna
- AI: OpenAI API for LLM
- Vector Database: Pinecone for embeddings
- Hosting: Cloudflare

**Development Process:**
- Built in 2-3 weeks
- Launched with bugs intentionally
- "Ship first, iterate later" philosophy
- Leveraged existing infrastructure from Feather
- Used embeddings-based approach (not fine-tuning)

**Initial Investment:** $500

**Development Philosophy:**
> "Get the working product to the hands of actual customers as fast as possible... Once someone actually uses the product, the product roadmap will get built on its own."

### Launch Strategy

**Platforms:** Twitter → Hacker News → Product Hunt (sequential, 3 days)

**Launch Date:** March 2023 (early)

**Pre-launch:**
- 10,000 Twitter followers from previous work on Feather
- Active in indie hacker community
- Built anticipation with teaser tweets
- No extensive pre-launch waitlist or marketing

**Launch Execution:**

**Day 1: Twitter**
> "I decided to work on it, learnt everything I needed to build the product, and within 2-3 weeks, I have a product ready, which had a lot of bugs, but I just launched it on Twitter with a tweet."

- Launch tweet went viral
- 15,000 website visitors on day 1
- First customers within first hour
- Unexpected viral momentum

**Day 2: Hacker News**
- Posted "Show HN" submission
- Reached front page for several hours
- Significant technical audience traffic
- Sustained interest beyond Twitter spike

**Day 3: Product Hunt**
- Launched on Product Hunt
- Day 1: 15,000 visitors, multiple customers in first hour
- Week 1: 200+ paying customers
- Month 1: $10,000 MRR
- Viral across all three platforms

**Founder Quote:**
> "I haven't done anything extra for PH launch... I just fill the form, click submit."

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Explosive Launch (Week 1 - March 2023)
**Revenue:** Unknown exact, but 200+ paying customers

**What Happened:**
- Perfect timing: AI hype was peaking
- Multi-platform launch created compound virality
- Technical community embraced the tool
- DDOS attacks from bad actors (growth pain)

**Key Tactics:**
- Sequential platform launches (Twitter → HN → PH)
- No free tier (avoided API cost explosion)
- Rapid bug fixes during launch week
- Direct founder engagement in comments

**Challenges:**
- "Sleepless nights" dealing with DDOS attacks
- Infrastructure scaling issues
- Massive API costs from viral traffic
- Bug reports flooding in

#### Phase 2: Reaching $10K MRR (Month 1)
**Revenue:** $10,000 MRR

**What Happened:**
- Continued adding customers daily
- Word-of-mouth in tech community
- Reached 200+ paying customers
- Product improvements based on feedback

**Marketing Channels:**
- Twitter (primary): Continued viral discussions
- Hacker News: Ongoing organic mentions
- Product Hunt: Sustained discovery traffic
- Word of mouth: Users sharing with colleagues
- Google (branded searches): "SiteGPT" searches

#### Phase 3: The Churn Reality (Month 2-3)
**Revenue:** Dropped to $5,000 MRR (50% churn)

**What Happened:**
- Initial hype customers churned out
- Many signed up to "try AI" not solve real problems
- Founder acknowledges: "Churn is very high for AI products"

**Key Realization:**
> "it will always be a leaky bucket"

**Response:**
- Focused on customers with real use cases
- Improved product for genuine business needs
- Stopped optimizing for hype, started optimizing for retention

#### Phase 4: Stabilization (Month 4-6)
**Revenue:** $15,000 MRR

**What Happened:**
- Found product-market fit with real businesses
- Lower churn rate (~10% stabilized from ~20%)
- Customers using for actual customer support
- Focus shifted to retention over acquisition

**Growth Tactics:**
- Customer feedback implementation
- Feature improvements for real use cases
- Better onboarding and documentation
- Responsive support

#### Phase 5: Peak Growth (Month 7-11 / Feb 2024)
**Revenue:** $95,000 MRR (peak reported)

**What Happened:**
- Significant feature expansions
- Enterprise customers likely came on board
- Continued improving based on customer needs
- Word-of-mouth in business communities

**Note:** Some conflicting reports on exact timeline and sustainability of this peak.

### Key Decisions

1. **No Free Tier from Day 1**
   - **Why:** Concerned about OpenAI API costs with viral traffic
   - **Result:** Filtered for committed customers, avoided cost explosion

2. **Launch with Bugs (Intentionally)**
   - **Why:** "Ship first, iterate later" philosophy
   - **Result:** Fast market validation, real user feedback

3. **Sequential Platform Launches**
   - **Why:** Build momentum across platforms
   - **Result:** Compound virality (Twitter → HN → PH)

4. **Use Embeddings (Not Fine-tuning)**
   - **Why:** Faster, cheaper, more flexible
   - **Result:** Lower costs, faster iteration

5. **Hire First Employee After Success**
   - **Why:** Overwhelmed with work, needed help
   - **Result:** Knowledge transfer challenges (still learning at time of AMA)

6. **Focus on Retention Over Growth (After Month 2)**
   - **Why:** High churn was unsustainable
   - **Result:** More stable, sustainable business

### Pivots / Changes

**Major Pivot: From Hype to Real Use Cases**
- Initially: Anyone wanting to "try AI"
- After churn: Focused on businesses with real support needs
- Result: Lower but more sustainable MRR

**Pricing Evolution:**
- Started: Paid-only, no free tier
- Later: Unknown if free tier was added
- Focus: Higher prices for committed customers

**Feature Evolution:**
- Initially: Basic chatbot trained on website
- Later: Advanced customization, better embedding, multi-language
- Driven by: Real customer feedback

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** Twitter (10K followers at launch)
- Building in public for 3+ years
- Launch tweet went viral
- Continued engagement and updates

**Secondary Channels:**

**Failed Attempts:**
> "Newsletter sponsorships yielded 500 visits but zero signups—far underperforming organic Twitter reach."

**Founder's Philosophy:**
> "Everything is about distribution"

> "Don't try to build an audience... Just start sharing about your business on Twitter... The audience grew automatically... It certainly takes time... More than 3 years now."

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Paid plans only (no free tier)

**Initial Pricing:** Unknown specific tiers

**Rationale:**
- Avoid OpenAI API cost explosion from free users
- Filter for serious customers
- Sustainable from day 1

**Churn Management:**
- Initial churn: ~20%
- Stabilized churn: ~10% (after 2-3 months)
- Focus: Retaining paying customers over acquiring free users

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** DDOS attacks "almost every day" in first weeks
   - **Solution:** Infrastructure hardening, Cloudflare protection
   - **Result:** Stabilized platform, sleepless nights for founder

2. **Challenge:** 50% customer churn after month 1
   - **Solution:** Focus on customers with real use cases, improve retention features
   - **Result:** Churn dropped to ~10%, more sustainable business

3. **Challenge:** High OpenAI API costs
   - **Solution:** No free tier, optimize embedding usage, efficient queries
   - **Result:** Maintained profitability despite high traffic

4. **Challenge:** Scaling rapidly while solo
   - **Solution:** Hired first employee, delegated some work
   - **Result:** Still learning delegation at time of AMA

5. **Challenge:** Product roadmap uncertainty
   - **Solution:** Let paying customers define roadmap through feedback
   - **Result:** Product-market fit for real businesses

6. **Challenge:** High competition in AI space
   - **Solution:** Ignored competitors, focused on own customers
   - **Founder Quote:** "I don't look at competitors when working on a product... I didn't see any point caring about them."
   - **Result:** Differentiated by execution speed and founder responsiveness
