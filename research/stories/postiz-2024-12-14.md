# Postiz Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

**Personal Frustration with Existing Solutions:**
Nevo David identified a 20-year-old market lacking a quality open-source solution: social media scheduling. As a developer himself, he was frustrated with:
- Proprietary tools with vendor lock-in
- Expensive pricing forcing developers to pay for features they could self-host
- Lack of control over infrastructure and data

**Key Insight:**
The developer community specifically wanted:
- Open-source alternatives to proprietary tools
- Self-hosting capabilities
- Pay-only-for-cloud-costs model
- Full API access for automation

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** September 2024 (initial launch)

**Initial Features:**
- Social media post scheduling
- Multi-platform support
- Self-hosting capability (Docker)
- Cloud hosting option (paid)
- Public API for integrations

**Tech Stack:**
- Mono-repo architecture
- Docker for self-hosting
- n8n integration for workflow automation
- Public API for developer access

**Development Process:**
- Built with open-source-first philosophy
- Community-driven feature development
- All code publicly available on GitHub (gitroomhq/postiz-app)
- Focus on developer feedback over extensive pre-launch planning

**Initial Development Principles:**
1. "Everything (but I mean everything) must be open-sourced"
2. Charge only for cloud costs, never force developers to pay
3. Listen to community requests immediately

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** GitHub + Open-Source Communities

**Pre-launch:**
- No traditional pre-launch marketing
- Built in public from day one
- Focus on open-source credibility

**Launch Tactics:**
- Listed on Awesome OSS repositories
- Posted on self-hosted directories
- Promoted on Reddit r/selfhosted community
- Shared on DEV.to developer community
- Released minor features as separate announcements for repeated visibility

**Launch Results:**
- 4.79M Docker downloads (cumulative)
- Strong GitHub community engagement
- Featured on open-source discovery platforms

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Initial Launch (September 2024)
- First revenue from cloud hosting subscriptions
- Community began requesting features
- Docker self-hosting proved popular distribution channel

#### Phase 2: Community Learning (July 2025)

#### Phase 3: Pivot to Automation Audience (July-August 2024)

#### Phase 4: Scaling (August 2024 - Present)

### Key Decisions

1. **Open-Source Everything**
   - **Why:** Build trust with developer community, use OS as distribution channel
   - **Result:** 4.79M Docker downloads, strong community engagement

2. **Pivot to Automation Developers (July 2024)**
   - **Why:** General users wouldn't pay, automation users saw clear value
   - **Result:** Revenue doubled in one month ($6.5K → $12.6K MRR)

3. **n8n Integration Priority**
   - **Why:** Automation community was willing to pay for integrations
   - **Result:** Opened entire ecosystem of automation builders as customers

4. **Affiliate Program Launch**
   - **Why:** Organic promotion by automation content creators
   - **Result:** Extended customer lifetime value, reduced CAC

5. **Marketing Parity with Coding**
   - **Why:** "Market as much as coding or more" for product visibility
   - **Result:** Consistent growth, avoided "build it and they will come" trap

### Pivots & Changes

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** SEO & Backlinks

**Secondary Channels:**
1. **Community Platforms (Reddit, DEV.to)**
   - r/selfhosted: Self-hosting announcements
   - DEV.to: Developer-focused content
   - Result: Consistent free traffic

2. **Cold Outreach**
   - Skool communities focused on automation
   - n8n user groups
   - Result: July-August revenue spike

3. **Organic Integration Marketing**
   - YouTube automation tutorial creators
   - Template builders using Postiz
   - n8n workflow sharers
   - Result: Extended LTV, organic promotion

**Failed Attempts:**
- Traditional social media marketing to general audience (low conversion)
- Targeting non-technical users (unwilling to pay)

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Subscription-based cloud hosting

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Free: Self-hosted (Docker) with full features
- Paid: Cloud hosting subscriptions (actual pricing tiers not disclosed)
- Value proposition: Pay for convenience, not features

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Primary:** Cloud hosting subscriptions
2. **Secondary:** Affiliate marketing partnerships

**Key Metrics:**
- MRR Growth: $6.5K → $12.6K → $14.2K (3-month period)
- Docker Downloads: 4.79M
- Conversion Rate: Not disclosed
- Churn Rate: Not disclosed

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Initial mono-repo architecture was complex
   - **Solution:** Solved with Docker containerization
   - **Result:** Simplified deployment, increased adoption

2. **Challenge:** Wrong target audience (general social media users)
   - **Solution:** Pivoted to automation developers after analyzing paying customers
   - **Result:** Revenue doubled in one month

3. **Challenge:** Solo founder burnout
   - **Context:** Working "200%" with newborn daughter
   - **Solution:** Not yet fully resolved, acknowledged need for sustainability
   - **Result:** Ongoing challenge affecting founder health

4. **Challenge:** Competing with 20-year-old established market
   - **Solution:** Open-source differentiation + developer-first approach
   - **Result:** Carved niche in automation/developer segment

5. **Challenge:** Feature requests overwhelming single developer
   - **Solution:** Community prioritization - implement most-requested first
   - **Result:** Docker support became killer feature
