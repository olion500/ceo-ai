# Papermark Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

After Iuliia Shnai's first startup (EdTech) collapsed in late 2022, requiring her to fire a 10-person team, she experienced depression but committed to daily social media posting on Twitter and LinkedIn. Through this exposure to indie hacking, she learned coding despite having no technical background (coming from PhD/academia).

Throughout 2023, she built **10 products** rapidly. The insight for Papermark came from identifying the need for a better alternative to DocSend - an open-source document sharing tool with analytics.

**Key Insight:** After 11 failed products, they found product-market fit with Papermark as an open-source alternative to existing solutions.

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** One weekend

**Initial Features:**
- Uploading a document
- Sharing the link
- Seeing basic analytics

**Tech Stack:**

Marketing Website:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- shadcn/ui
- Vercel
- Railway

Product:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- shadcn/ui
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- NextAuth.js
- Tinybird
- Resend
- Stripe
- Vercel

**Development Process:**
- Marc (co-founder) built the initial version in a single weekend
- Deliberately minimal MVP approach
- Marc had modest expectations initially
- Open-source from the beginning (available on GitHub)

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn), Reddit, Dev.to, Product Hunt

**Date:** 2023

**Pre-launch:**
- Building in public on social media
- Daily posting commitment established during recovery from first startup failure
- Engaged with indie hacker community

**Launch Results:**
- Marc's launch tweet went viral
- Reached $500 MRR simultaneously with another product (Postli)
- Immediate validation of product-market fit

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Initial Traction (2023)

#### Phase 2: Full-Time Commitment (Early 2024)

#### Phase 3: SEO-Driven Scaling (2024)

#### Phase 4: Current State (Late 2024)

### Key Decisions

1. **Separate Tech Stacks for Marketing and Product**
   - **Why:** Enable independent optimization for each
   - **Result:** Marketing and product could evolve at different paces using Next.js

2. **Pricing Evolution**
   - **Initial:** $29/month
   - **Current:** 4 paid tiers plus free tier
   - **Top tier:** $349/month
   - **Most popular:** $79/month
   - **Why:** Freemium model significantly boosted growth
   - **Result:** Revenue expansion through price tiering

3. **Open Source Strategy**
   - **Why:** Build trust, enable community contributions, differentiate from closed-source competitors
   - **Result:** Positioned as alternative to expensive proprietary solutions

4. **Content-Driven Growth Over Sales**
   - **Why:** Shnai "hated" cold LinkedIn sales from first startup experience
   - **Result:** Avoided channels that didn't align with personal strengths, focused on SEO/content

5. **Rejected Fundraising Entirely**
   - **Why:** First startup required constant fundraising focus, led to unsustainable AppSumo sales channels
   - **Result:** Maintained control, avoided investor pressure, sustainable growth

### Pivots & Changes

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** SEO (Bottom-of-funnel content)
- "~1,000 pages of content" created
- Comparison pages ("Alternative to DocSend")
- How-to guides
- Localized landing pages
- Micro tools

**Secondary Channels:**
- Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn): Early validation and community building
- Reddit: Launch traffic and engagement
- Dev.to: Developer community reach
- Product Hunt: Launch visibility

**Failed Attempts:**
- Cold LinkedIn sales (from first startup)
- AppSumo deals (from first startup, described as unsustainable)

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Freemium with multiple paid tiers

**Pricing Evolution:**
  - Entry tier: Unknown
  - Most popular: $79/month
  - Top tier: $349/month

**Conversion Rate:** Not disclosed

**Business Model:**
- SaaS subscription
- Open-source product with commercial hosting
- Usage-based limits on free tier

## Founder's Lessons & Reflections

### What They Say Worked

> "If your product is an alternative to some existing product, USE THAT. Write about it." - Iuliia Shnai

**Context:** On SEO strategy for Papermark as DocSend alternative

> "After 11 failed products...hit $45k MRR in a little over a year"

**Context:** On persistence and rapid iteration approach

- Market need for better alternative solution (open-source vs. proprietary)
- AI enabling faster content creation (for SEO at scale)
- Prior failure lessons applied (avoiding fundraising, unsustainable channels)
- Focus on single dominant growth channel (SEO)
- Building what founder enjoys doing rather than forced approaches

### What They Say Didn't Work

> [Implied: Cold LinkedIn sales - "I hated it"]

**Context:** From first startup experience, led to focusing on content instead

- First 10 products in 2023 (only Papermark achieved PMF)
- AppSumo deals from first startup (described as unsustainable)
- Fundraising approach (first startup required constant investor focus)
- Postli (LinkedIn post generator) failed to achieve product-market fit despite same $500 MRR as Papermark initially

### Their Advice to Others

> "Linear growth is totally fine to me" - Referenced philosophy (rejecting hockey-stick pressure)

**Context:** On sustainable bootstrapping vs. VC-backed growth expectations

- Build multiple products quickly to find product-market fit
- Focus on channels aligned with your strengths
- Open source can be competitive advantage
- Bottom-of-funnel content drives sustainable growth
- Freemium significantly boosts growth

**Success Formula Identified by Founder:**
1. Market need for better alternative solution
2. AI enabling faster execution (content, development)
3. Prior failure lessons applied
4. Luck
5. Focus on single dominant growth channel

### Founder's Mindset & Decision-Making

**Initial Beliefs:**
- Needed to raise funding for success (from first startup)
- Sales channels like AppSumo were necessary for distribution
- Cold outreach was required for B2B SaaS

**Changed Beliefs:**
- Bootstrapping enables vision clarity and control
- Content/SEO can be primary growth engine
- Personal strengths matter more than "best practices"
- Multiple rapid experiments find PMF faster than one big bet
- Open source is competitive advantage, not disadvantage

**Critical Decisions Explained:**

1. **Going Full-Time at $1K MRR**
   - **Context:** Both founders had other income sources
   - **Options Considered:** Wait for higher revenue, continue part-time
   - **Why Chose This:** Early traction signal, wanted to accelerate growth
   - **Outcome:** Scaled from $1K to $45K MRR in 12 months

2. **Focusing on SEO Over Sales**
   - **Context:** Shnai "hated" cold sales from first startup
   - **Options Considered:** Cold outreach, paid ads, partnerships
   - **Why Chose This:** Aligned with strengths, sustainable long-term
   - **Outcome:** ~1,000 pages of content became primary growth driver

3. **Open Source Strategy**
   - **Context:** Competing against established proprietary DocSend
   - **Options Considered:** Closed-source SaaS, open-core, fully open
   - **Why Chose This:** Differentiation, community trust, market positioning
   - **Outcome:** Positioned as "better alternative" to expensive tools
