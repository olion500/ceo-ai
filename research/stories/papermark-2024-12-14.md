## The Story

### Problem Discovery

After Iuliia Shnai's first startup (EdTech) collapsed in late 2022, requiring her to fire a 10-person team, she experienced depression but committed to daily social media posting on Twitter and LinkedIn. Through this exposure to indie hacking, she learned coding despite having no technical background (coming from PhD/academia).

Throughout 2023, she built **10 products** rapidly. The insight for Papermark came from identifying the need for a better alternative to DocSend - an open-source document sharing tool with analytics.

**Key Insight:** After 11 failed products, they found product-market fit with Papermark as an open-source alternative to existing solutions.

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** One weekend

**Initial Features:**
- Uploading a document
- Sharing the link
- Seeing basic analytics

**Tech Stack:**

Marketing Website:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- shadcn/ui
- Vercel
- Railway

Product:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- shadcn/ui
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- NextAuth.js
- Tinybird
- Resend
- Stripe
- Vercel

**Development Process:**
- Marc (co-founder) built the initial version in a single weekend
- Deliberately minimal MVP approach
- Marc had modest expectations initially
- Open-source from the beginning (available on GitHub)

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn), Reddit, Dev.to, Product Hunt

**Date:** 2023

**Pre-launch:**
- Building in public on social media
- Daily posting commitment established during recovery from first startup failure
- Engaged with indie hacker community

**Launch Results:**
- Marc's launch tweet went viral
- Reached $500 MRR simultaneously with another product (Postli)
- Immediate validation of product-market fit

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Initial Traction (2023)
- **What happened:** Both Papermark and Postli (LinkedIn post generator) reached $500 MRR
- **Key tactic:** Social media posting, Reddit, Dev.to, Product Hunt
- **Result:** Papermark showed stronger product-market fit than Postli

#### Phase 2: Full-Time Commitment (Early 2024)
- **What happened:** Both founders committed full-time when revenue hit $1K MRR (January 2024)
- **Key tactic:** Shifted focus entirely to Papermark after seeing better traction
- **Result:** Revenue growth acceleration

#### Phase 3: SEO-Driven Scaling (2024)
- **What happened:** Aggressive content strategy with "~1,000 pages of content"
- **Key tactic:** Bottom-of-funnel articles targeting solution-seekers
- **Result:** Primary growth channel, scaled from $1K to $45K MRR in 12 months

#### Phase 4: Current State (Late 2024)
- **What happened:** $45K MRR achieved
- **Key tactic:** Continued SEO focus, new channel testing, churn reduction
- **Result:** Targeting $1M ARR by year-end

### Key Decisions

1. **Separate Tech Stacks for Marketing and Product**
   - **Why:** Enable independent optimization for each
   - **Result:** Marketing and product could evolve at different paces using Next.js

2. **Pricing Evolution**
   - **Initial:** $29/month
   - **Current:** 4 paid tiers plus free tier
   - **Top tier:** $349/month
   - **Most popular:** $79/month
   - **Why:** Freemium model significantly boosted growth
   - **Result:** Revenue expansion through price tiering

3. **Open Source Strategy**
   - **Why:** Build trust, enable community contributions, differentiate from closed-source competitors
   - **Result:** Positioned as alternative to expensive proprietary solutions

4. **Content-Driven Growth Over Sales**
   - **Why:** Shnai "hated" cold LinkedIn sales from first startup experience
   - **Result:** Avoided channels that didn't align with personal strengths, focused on SEO/content

5. **Rejected Fundraising Entirely**
   - **Why:** First startup required constant fundraising focus, led to unsustainable AppSumo sales channels
   - **Result:** Maintained control, avoided investor pressure, sustainable growth

### Pivots & Changes

- **From multiple products to single focus:** Built 10 products in 2023, narrowed to Papermark after seeing traction
- **From social-first to SEO-first:** Initial growth from social platforms, later shifted primary focus to SEO content
- **From learning to code to building products:** Shnai had no technical background in 2019, learned to code by 2023

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel:** SEO (Bottom-of-funnel content)
- "~1,000 pages of content" created
- Comparison pages ("Alternative to DocSend")
- How-to guides
- Localized landing pages
- Micro tools
- **Strategy:** "If your product is an alternative to some existing product, USE THAT. Write about it."

**Secondary Channels:**
- Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn): Early validation and community building
- Reddit: Launch traffic and engagement
- Dev.to: Developer community reach
- Product Hunt: Launch visibility

**Failed Attempts:**
- Cold LinkedIn sales (from first startup)
- AppSumo deals (from first startup, described as unsustainable)

### Revenue Model

**Pricing:** Freemium with multiple paid tiers

**Pricing Evolution:**
- **Initial:** $29/month single tier
- **Current:** Free tier + 4 paid plans
  - Entry tier: Unknown
  - Most popular: $79/month
  - Top tier: $349/month

**Conversion Rate:** Not disclosed

**Business Model:**
- SaaS subscription
- Open-source product with commercial hosting
- Usage-based limits on free tier

## All Tactics & Strategies Used

### Tactic 1: Weekend MVP Approach
- **What They Did:** Built functional MVP in one weekend with minimal features
- **How They Implemented:** Focused on core value proposition only: upload, share, analytics
- **Context:** After 10 failed products, needed rapid validation before investing more time
- **Results Achieved:** Viral launch tweet, immediate $500 MRR
- **Time Investment:** One weekend
- **Cost:** Development time only (no paid tools initially)

- **Time Investment:** Daily (15-30 minutes per post)
- **Cost:** Time only

### Tactic 5: Freemium Model
- **What They Did:** Offered free tier alongside paid plans
- **How They Implemented:** Usage-based limits on free tier, multiple paid tiers for expansion
- **Context:** Lower barrier to entry, let users experience value before paying
- **Results Achieved:** "Significantly boosted growth"

- **Context:** First startup forced unsustainable channels, learned to align with strengths
- **Results Achieved:** Sustainable growth without burnout
- **Time Investment:** Same total effort, better direction
- **Cost:** Opportunity cost of not doing sales (but sales wouldn't have worked anyway)
