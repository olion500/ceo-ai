# Bank Statement Converter Success Story


## The Story

### Problem Discovery

Angus Cheng owned Dragon King Creation Limited, a Hong Kong LLC managing app revenue. During annual audits, he faced a recurring pain point: converting PDF bank statements to Excel manually. When he asked his accountant how they were handling the PDFs, the accountant revealed: **"I copy and pasted the data into Excel."**

Upon investigating with other accounting professionals, Cheng discovered this was **industry-standard practice**. Accountants acknowledged attempting PDF-to-Excel conversion software, but found it unreliable and slow.

**Market Validation Insight:**
Many accountants manage numerous clients with thousands of monthly transactions across multiple accounts—all requiring manual data extraction. The inefficiency suggested genuine market demand.

**Personal Trigger:**
In late 2020, Angus rage-quit his financial engineering job at Bullish.com (a crypto exchange) without a safety net. He had been earning $150,000+ HKD monthly (~$19,000 USD) and deliberately avoided buying a house to maintain startup capital flexibility. His philosophy: **"Having a mortgage adds pressure on you to make money."**

### MVP Development

**Timeline:** 1 week from concept to production
**Launch Date:** April 4, 2021
**First User:** April 17, 2021 (via Google Search Ad)

**Initial Team:**
- Angus (backend developer)
- One frontend developer friend (worked for ~1 month, then left amicably)

**Tech Stack:**
- Linux servers on Amazon Web Services (EC2 + Amazon Textract for OCR)
- React (frontend)
- Domain registration + basic hosting
- Total initial investment: <$100 USD

**Development Philosophy:**
Rather than extensive market validation, Angus proceeded with the assumption: **"If I needed this, other people in Hong Kong might need this too."** No formal validation was conducted before development began.

**Technical Approach:**
Initially attempted to create one universal algorithm supporting all bank statement formats. After realizing this produced poor output quality, pivoted to bank-specific solutions for better accuracy. First supported formats:
- HSBC Personal
- HSBC Credit Card
- HSBC Commercial
- Westpac Personal

### Launch Strategy

**Platform:** Own website (bankstatementconverter.com)
**Date:** April 4, 2021

**Pre-launch:**
- Minimal preparation
- No email list building
- No audience cultivation

**Launch Approach:**
Immediately purchased Google Search Ads on April 17, 2021 to validate if people would pay.

**Launch Results:**
- First user arrived same day via Google Ad
- Co-founder dropped out after first user, saying "the service was too boring"
- Angus continued solo

### Growth Journey

#### Phase 1: Paid Ads Experimentation (April - October 2021)
**Revenue:** $0 → ~$500 MRR

**Google Ads Investment:**
- Total spent: ~$40,000 HKD (~$5,000 USD) over 6 months
- Generated ~150 daily users
- **Result: Unprofitable**

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- April 2021: $0
- May 2021: $101 USD (first revenue via pay-per-use credits)
- June 2021: $160 USD
- July 2021: $308 USD (switched to quarterly subscription model at $20)
- August 2021: $235 USD
- September 2021: $264 USD
- October 2021: $472 USD

**Key Decision:**
Discontinued Google Ads in October 2021. Traffic dropped from 150 to 30 daily users, BUT **"people started clicking on my site through search results"** instead, improving organic rankings.

#### Phase 2: Organic SEO Growth (October 2021 - February 2022)
**Revenue:** $500 → $1,000 MRR

**Content Marketing Strategy:**
Started blog at bankstatementconverter.com/blog with philosophy: **"Let me write stuff that people will be interested in reading"** rather than volume-based content.

**Major Milestone:**
One blog post reached the **HackerNews frontpage**, significantly boosting SEO rankings.

**Revenue Progress:**
- November 2021: $671 USD
- December 2021: $961 USD
- January 2022: $1,290 USD
- **February 13, 2022: $1,531 USD (crossed $1K MRR)**
- March 2022: $1,498 USD

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** ~$77,000 HKD (~$10,000 USD)

**Founder Reflection:**
Despite reaching $1,000 MRR, Angus acknowledged: "The app doesn't yet cover living expenses but I'm optimistic about future growth." He identified loneliness as **"the hardest thing"** in the process, missing collaborative work after his co-founder departed.

#### Phase 3: Enterprise Customer Acquisition (March - September 2022)
**Revenue:** $1,000 → $4,000 MRR

**Key Growth Driver:**
In late June 2022, started discussions with an enterprise customer needing JSON API for bulk document processing. Spent months developing this capability.

**Major Inflection Point:**
**July 2022:** Convinced this customer to purchase a large subscription plan, generating ~$63,000 HKD (~$8,000 USD) in one month.

**Mid-September 2022:** MRR exceeded $4,000

**Product Improvements:**
Completed 503 Git commits over seven months improving conversion accuracy across different bank statement formats. Angus's philosophy: **"If we do it correctly, you're very likely to buy a subscription."**

**Future Plans Identified:**
- Website localization (Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, German)
- Target enterprise segments (accounting firms, financial institutions, insurance companies)
- Xero accounting software integration
- Active user outreach (was only doing reactive support)
- In-app feedback mechanism

**Projection:** Estimated reaching $10,000 MRR within weeks.

#### Phase 4: Autopilot Operations (October 2022 - Present)
**Revenue:** $4,000 → $16,000 MRR

**Current Status (as of 2024):**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue: **$16,000 USD**
- Weekly Traffic: ~4,200 users
- Traffic Source: 100% organic (Google search results)
- Marketing Spend: **$0**

**Business Expenses (~$770/month):**
- AWS (EC2 + Amazon Textract): $738
- Netlify: $20
- FastMail: $50/year
- IntelliJ IDEA: $101/year

**Net Profit:** ~$15,230/month (95% margin)

**Personal Draw:** ~$10,000/month

**Lifestyle:**
Angus describes running on **"easy street"** with minimal ongoing effort: **"More and more money goes into my bank account while I do whatever the hell I feel like doing."**

**Autopilot Strategy:**
- Continuous product improvement (refining algorithms for more banks)
- Minimal customer support (basic service only)
- Passive growth through subscription retention
- Focus: Keep customers happy, they'll tell their friends

**Notable Achievement:**
Bought a house with **cold hard cash** rather than taking a mortgage, using high-interest savings account (4.75% from Westpac).

### Key Decisions

1. **Quit Full-Time Job Without Safety Net**
   - **Why:** Frustrated at crypto exchange job, wanted to build his own product
   - **Context:** Had strong financial runway from saving most of his $19K/month salary
   - **Result:** Forced himself to make the business work; reached financial independence

2. **Abandon Paid Advertising After 6 Months**
   - **Why:** Spent $5,000, generated poor ROI ($858 spent for $248 revenue initially, then $3,050 for $740)
   - **Alternative Considered:** Continue optimizing CPC campaigns
   - **Result:** Traffic dropped 80% initially, but organic search rankings improved dramatically; eliminated customer acquisition costs

3. **Pivot from Universal to Bank-Specific Algorithms**
   - **Why:** One algorithm for all banks produced poor output quality
   - **Context:** Customer complaints about accuracy
   - **Result:** Significantly improved conversion rates; customers more likely to subscribe

4. **Switch from Pay-Per-Use to Subscription Model (July 2021)**
   - **Why:** Subscriptions "lead to much better conversions"
   - **Initial Model:** One-time credits
   - **New Model:** Quarterly subscription at $20
   - **Result:** Improved cash flow predictability and customer lifetime value

5. **Abandon Cold Email Marketing**
   - **Why:** ~1 in 1,000 conversion rate; Gmail account banned for excessive volume
   - **Context:** Hired marketing consultant for two weeks, was unsatisfied, took over personally
   - **Result:** Switched to Fastmail, but abandoned channel entirely; focused on organic

6. **Add Scanned Document Support**
   - **Why:** Customer complaints about scanned statements not working
   - **Context:** Customer support revealed this as major pain point
   - **Result:** Expanded addressable market; improved customer satisfaction

7. **Build JSON API for Enterprise Customer**
   - **Why:** Large customer needed bulk processing capability
   - **Context:** Late June 2022 - months of development work
   - **Result:** Single customer generated ~$8,000 revenue spike in July 2022

### Pivots / Changes

**Major Pivot:** From paid acquisition to organic/content marketing (October 2021)

**Product Evolution:**
- Started: Simple bank statement PDF converter
- Added: Scanned document OCR support
- Added: JSON API for bulk processing
- Added: Support for more bank formats (503 commits over 7 months)

**Failed Experiment:**
- Cold email marketing via hired consultant + personal execution
- Result: Account banned, poor conversion rates, abandoned

### Marketing Channels

**Primary Channel: Organic Search (SEO)**

**Secondary Channel: Content Marketing**

**Failed Channels:**
1. **Google Ads:** $5,000 spent, unprofitable ($858 → $248, then $3,050 → $740)
2. **Cold Email:** ~1 in 1,000 conversion, Gmail banned, low ROI

**Customer Support as Marketing:**
- Responded personally to every support inquiry
- Added features based on customer complaints (e.g., scanned statement support)
- Philosophy: **"Keep the customers happy, and they'll tell their mates"**

### Revenue Model

**Current Pricing (Subscription + Usage-Based):**

**Three Tiers:**
1. **Tier 1:** 400 page credits for $30/month
2. **Tier 2:** 4,000 page credits for $99/month
3. **Tier 3:** Annual option at $599/year

**Freemium Not Mentioned** - appears to be paid-only from the start

**Pricing Evolution:**

**Conversion Rate:** Not explicitly stated, but Angus notes: **"If we do it correctly, you're very likely to buy a subscription"** after improving accuracy

**Key Insight:**
Subscription model creates natural growth: **"If customers stay happy, subscription revenue naturally increases—no constant hustle required."**

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Universal algorithm produced poor quality output
   - **Solution:** Built bank-specific algorithms for each supported bank
   - **Result:** Significantly improved accuracy; better conversions

2. **Challenge:** Unprofitable paid advertising
   - **Solution:** Abandoned Google Ads entirely; pivoted to content marketing
   - **Result:** Eliminated CAC; improved unit economics dramatically

3. **Challenge:** Scanned statements not working
   - **Solution:** Integrated Amazon Textract OCR for scanned documents
   - **Result:** Expanded addressable market; reduced customer complaints

4. **Challenge:** Loneliness as solo founder
   - **Solution:** No specific solution mentioned; accepted as part of journey
   - **Impact:** Identified as **"the hardest thing"** but persevered

5. **Challenge:** Co-founder departure after first user
   - **Solution:** Continued solo; managed both backend and frontend
   - **Result:** Maintained full control and 100% equity

6. **Challenge:** Geographic limitation (mainly English-speaking customers)
   - **Solution:** Planned website localization (Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, German)
   - **Result:** Not yet implemented as of last update

7. **Challenge:** Cold email marketing failure
   - **Solution:** Abandoned channel after Gmail ban; focused on organic
   - **Result:** Better alignment with sustainable growth strategy

### Founder's Mindset & Decision-Making

**Initial Beliefs:**
- Universal algorithm approach was wrong; bank-specific solutions required
- Paid advertising (Google Ads, cold email) unsustainable for this business
- Solo founder journey is lonely but viable
- Content marketing provides better long-term ROI than paid ads

**Critical Decisions Explained:**

1. **Rage-Quit Job Without Safety Net**
   - **Context:** Frustrated at Bullish.com crypto exchange
   - **Options Considered:** Stay employed and side hustle vs. full-time commitment
   - **Why Chose This:** Wanted full focus; had financial runway; avoided mortgage pressure
   - **Outcome:** Forced commitment led to success; achieved financial independence in 18 months

2. **Abandon Google Ads After $5K Spend**
   - **Context:** Spending $1,000/month with poor returns (150 daily users, unprofitable)
   - **Options Considered:** Continue optimizing ads vs. pivot to organic
   - **Why Chose This:** **"Don't assume paid ads will eventually become profitable through tweaking"**
   - **Outcome:** Traffic dropped 80% initially; organic rankings improved dramatically; CAC eliminated

3. **Build Bank-Specific Algorithms**
   - **Context:** Customer complaints about poor output quality from universal algorithm
   - **Options Considered:** Keep improving universal approach vs. separate algorithms
   - **Why Chose This:** Quality over convenience; better conversion rates
   - **Outcome:** 503 commits over 7 months; significantly improved accuracy and subscriptions

4. **Accept Enterprise Customization Request**
   - **Context:** June 2022 - large customer needed JSON API for bulk processing
   - **Options Considered:** Decline custom work vs. invest months in development
   - **Why Chose This:** Potential for large recurring revenue from single customer
   - **Outcome:** ~$8K revenue spike in July 2022; propelled $1K → $4K MRR growth
