# Scratch Your Own Itch

**Category:** idea-discovery
**Success Rate:** High (80%+ of analyzed success stories)
**Time Investment:** Immediate (no research needed)
**Difficulty:** Easy (you already know the problem)

## What Is This Pattern?

Build solutions to problems you personally face. Instead of researching markets or analyzing trends, start with frustrations you encounter in your daily life or work. If you need it, others likely do too.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Personal Pain Points**: Notice recurring frustrations in your work/life
2. **Validate Others Have Same Problem**: Ask 5-10 people if they face this issue
3. **Build What You Need**: Create the solution you wish existed
4. **Share With Similar People**: Find communities facing the same problem

## Real Examples (Ranked by Success)

### 1. TypingMind - Tony Dinh ($83K MRR)
- **Context**: Frustrated with ChatGPT's slow, unorganized interface
- **Execution**: Built better ChatGPT UI in 3 days after API release
- **Results**: $22K in first 7 days, now $83K/month
- **Key Insight**: Perfect timing (3 days after API) + personal need = immediate PMF

### 2. ShipFast - Marc Lou ($50K MRR, $1.2M lifetime)
- **Context**: Spent hours rebuilding same tech stack (DNS, Stripe, auth) for 23 projects
- **Execution**: Compiled existing code into Next.js boilerplate
- **Results**: $4K/day, $1.2M+ lifetime revenue
- **Key Insight**: Developer tools + solving own repetitive problem = high demand

### 3. Pieter Levels - Nomad List ($1.5M ARR)
- **Context**: As digital nomad, needed to compare cities for remote work
- **Execution**: Built database of cities ranked for digital nomads
- **Results**: $1.5M+ ARR, portfolio $3M/year
- **Key Insight**: Niche community + being part of target audience = authentic product

### 4. Bank Statement Converter - Angus Cheng ($16K MRR)
- **Context**: Manually converting PDF bank statements to Excel for audit
- **Execution**: Built automated converter after seeing accountant do it manually
- **Results**: $16K/month on autopilot
- **Key Insight**: Boring repetitive task + many people do it = reliable revenue

### 5. Vampire Survivors - Luca Galante (£40M net worth)
- **Context**: Unemployed, wanted to practice coding with game he'd enjoy
- **Execution**: Built auto-attack survival game inspired by Magic Survival
- **Results**: £40M net worth, created new game genre
- **Key Insight**: Failed initially (itch.io), but persisted to Steam = breakthrough

## Why This Works

**Authentic Understanding**: You deeply know the problem because you live it daily
- No need for extensive user research
- Natural empathy for pain points
- Immediate validation when solution works for you

**Intrinsic Motivation**: Personal frustration keeps you going
- Won't quit when initial traction is low
- Genuine passion shows through in product
- Marketing feels natural (telling your story)

**Faster Validation**: If you need it, statistically others do too
- Target market is people like you
- Easy to find similar users (your communities)
- High conviction reduces analysis paralysis

## Prerequisites

- **Skills Required**: Ability to build solution yourself (or hire/partner)
- **Time Required**: Same as building for others, but clearer vision
- **Capital Required**: Minimal (you're the first user)
- **Other Requirements**: Actually experience the problem personally

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mistake**: Building for an imaginary version of yourself
   - **Why It Fails**: "I wish I exercised more" ≠ actual daily pain
   - **How to Avoid**: Only build for problems you currently have, not aspirational

2. **Mistake**: Solving a problem only you have (too niche)
   - **Why It Fails**: Market of one doesn't scale
   - **How to Avoid**: Validate 10+ others have same problem before building

3. **Mistake**: Over-engineering because you know too much
   - **Why It Fails**: Spending months on features users don't need
   - **How to Avoid**: Ship MVP that solves core problem, iterate based on feedback

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good Fit When:**
- You face recurring frustration in your work/domain
- You have skills to build the solution
- You can identify others with same problem
- Problem is specific and well-defined
- You're part of a community facing this issue

❌ **Bad Fit When:**
- Problem is hypothetical or aspirational
- You're not part of the target market
- Problem only exists in theory, not daily life
- You can't find 10+ others with same issue
- Solution requires massive resources you don't have
