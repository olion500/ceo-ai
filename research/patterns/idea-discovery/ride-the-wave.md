# Ride the Wave

## What Is This Pattern?

Launch products immediately after major platform/technology releases, riding the wave of market attention and demand. Perfect timing during explosive growth periods can 10-100x your potential.

## How It Works

1. **Monitor Platform Releases**: Watch for API launches, new models, paradigm shifts
2. **Move Within Days**: Build and ship MVP in 48 hours to 1 week
3. **Leverage Market Attention**: Everyone exploring new tech = built-in distribution
4. **First-Mover Advantage**: Be early enough to dominate before saturation
5. **Ride Momentum**: Market growth carries you faster than traditional launch

## Real Examples (Ranked by Success)

### 1. Harvey Legal AI - Winston Weinberg ($100M ARR)
- **Wave**: ChatGPT and GPT-3 release (late 2022)
- **Timing**:
  - Experimented with GPT-3 early 2022 (before mainstream)
  - Founded August 2022 (3 months before ChatGPT public release)
  - Launched November 2022 (perfect timing with AI boom)
- **Execution**: Cold emailed Sam Altman July 4th → same-day call → first OpenAI Startup Fund investment
- **Results**: $0 → $100M ARR in 35 months, rode legal AI wave
- **Key Insight**: Market was exploding with "AI for X" demand, legal was underserved

### 2. TypingMind - Tony Dinh ($50K+ MRR)
- **Wave**: ChatGPT API public release (February 2023)
- **Timing**:
  - ChatGPT API released late Feb 2023
  - Tony launched TypingMind immediately (weekend hack)
  - Product Hunt launch: $10K → $22K in 1 day
- **Execution**:
  - Built "better UI for ChatGPT" in 3 days
  - Launched while everyone was exploring ChatGPT
  - Perfect product-market fit due to timing
- **Results**: $500K revenue in first year, $1M ARR by month 21
- **Key Quote**: "Right place, right time" - timing was crucial
- **Key Insight**: Everyone trying ChatGPT = everyone frustrated with UI = instant demand

### 3. TalkNotes - Nico Jeannen ($200K exit at $7K MRR)
- **Wave**: AI voice-to-text boom (2023)
- **Timing**: Launched 2023 during AI hype peak
- **Execution**:
  - AI voice note to structured text converter
  - Rode AI trend for quick traction
  - $500 MRR in 2 months
- **Results**: $7K MRR in 11 months, sold for $200K
- **Key Insight**: AI timing enabled fast validation and lucrative exit

### 4. PhotoAI & InteriorAI - Pieter Levels ($103K MRR combined)
- **Wave**: AI image generation boom (2023)
- **Timing**: Launched AI products during 2023 AI explosion
- **Execution**:
  - PhotoAI: AI headshot generation
  - InteriorAI: AI interior design
  - Both rode AI wave for rapid growth
- **Results**:
  - PhotoAI: $65K MRR
  - InteriorAI: $38K MRR
  - Nomad List grew 7.5x in 2024 (AI momentum spillover)

## Why This Works

**Market Momentum**:
- Platform growth carries all apps in ecosystem
- Everyone exploring = massive organic discovery
- Media attention on category = free PR

**Reduced Competition**:
- Early movers face less competition
- Market not yet saturated
- Opportunity to become "the X for Y" early leader

**Built-in Distribution**:
- Platform communities actively seeking solutions
- Product Hunt/Twitter/Reddit buzz about new tech
- Journalists covering the wave

**User Willingness to Pay**:
- Early adopters less price-sensitive
- Excited to explore new capabilities
- Willing to pay for tools that unlock platform potential

## Prerequisites

- **Speed Required**: Must ship in days/weeks, not months
- **Market Sensing**: Ability to identify waves early (before saturation)
- **Technical Skills**: Can build and launch MVP extremely fast
- **Risk Tolerance**: Wave might crash (but downside limited if fast)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mistake**: Waiting for wave to be obvious
   - **Why It Fails**: By then, 100+ competitors already launched
   - **How to Avoid**: Build when platform is announced, launch within days
   - **Example**: TypingMind launched same week as ChatGPT API

2. **Mistake**: Over-engineering the MVP
   - **Why It Fails**: Miss the wave while building features
   - **How to Avoid**: Ship absolute minimum, iterate based on traction
   - **Example**: TalkNotes reached $500 MRR in 2 months with simple MVP

3. **Mistake**: Riding dying waves
   - **Why It Fails**: Launching NFT tools in 2023 (wave already crashed)
   - **How to Avoid**: Distinguish hype from lasting platforms (AI = platform, NFTs = fad)

4. **Mistake**: No defensibility beyond timing
   - **Why It Fails**: When wave recedes, you have no moat
   - **How to Avoid**: Use wave for traction, build moat during growth (brand, distribution, quality)

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good Fit When:**
- Major platform releases API or new capability
- Market clearly exploding (ChatGPT growth trajectory)
- You can build and ship in < 1 week
- Early adopter community exists (Product Hunt, Twitter, etc.)
- Platform unlikely to cannibalize your use case

❌ **Bad Fit When:**
- Wave is already 6+ months old (late)
- Platform is unproven (too risky)
- You need months to build MVP (too slow)
- Platform might shut down/change radically
- You're building for market that doesn't care about new tech

## Historical Waves & Outcomes

**Successful Waves:**
- **iPhone App Store (2008)**: Angry Birds, Instagram, etc.
- **Chrome Extensions (2010)**: Grammarly, LastPass, etc.
- **AWS/Cloud (2010s)**: Countless SaaS companies
- **ChatGPT API (2023)**: TypingMind, TalkNotes, Harvey, etc.

**Failed/Crashed Waves:**
- **Google Glass (2013)**: Dead platform
- **NFTs (2021-2022)**: Hype collapsed
- **Clubhouse clones (2021)**: Platform died
- **Crypto games (2021)**: Play-to-earn unsustainable

## Timing Indicators

**Green Lights** (Ride the Wave):
- ✅ Exponential user growth of platform
- ✅ Major tech company backing (OpenAI, Google, Apple)
- ✅ Clear API/developer ecosystem
- ✅ Mainstream media coverage starting
- ✅ Hundreds of "how to use X" tutorials emerging

**Red Lights** (Avoid):
- ❌ Platform growth flattening
- ❌ No clear business model for platform
- ❌ Regulatory threats
- ❌ No developer ecosystem
- ❌ Hype-driven only (no real usage)
