# Domain Expertise Gap

## What Is This Pattern?

Identify business opportunities by combining deep domain expertise in one field with technical skills from another. The intersection of insider knowledge and technical capability reveals problems that outsiders can't see and solutions they can't build.

**Core Insight:** "Insiders see problems outsiders can't"

## How It Works

Combine years of domain experience with technical skills to identify and solve problems that outsiders miss.
