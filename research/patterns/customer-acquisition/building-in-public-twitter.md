# Building in Public on Twitter

**Category:** customer-acquisition
**Success Rate:** Medium-High (requires consistency + authenticity)
**Time Investment:** 30-60 min daily for 1-3 years
**Difficulty:** Medium (consistency is hardest part)

## What Is This Pattern?

Share your journey, metrics, wins, and failures publicly on Twitter while building your product. Build an audience over time that becomes your distribution channel when you launch.

## How It Works

1. **Start Before You Need It**: Build audience 1-3 years before product launch
2. **Share Daily**: Coding experiments, revenue updates, challenges, learnings
3. **Be Authentic**: Real struggles + wins, not just highlights
4. **Engage Community**: Reply, help others, build relationships
5. **Launch to Audience**: When ready, you have built-in distribution

**Compounding Returns**:

- Years of posts create massive content library

## Prerequisites

- **Skills Required**:
  - Writing/communication skills
  - Willingness to be vulnerable publicly
  - Consistent discipline
- **Time Required**: 1-3 years of daily sharing (30-60 min/day)
- **Capital Required**: $0 (time only)
- **Other Requirements**:
  - Actually building something worth sharing
  - Authenticity (can't fake the journey)
  - Patience (slow compounding growth)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mistake**: Only sharing wins, hiding failures
   - **Why It Fails**: Looks fake, people don't connect
   - **How to Avoid**: Share struggles honestly, builds more trust

2. **Mistake**: Spamming product promotions
   - **Why It Fails**: People unfollow promotional accounts
   - **How to Avoid**: 90% value/journey, 10% promotion

3. **Mistake**: Giving up after 3 months of slow growth
   - **Why It Fails**: Compounding takes 1-3 years minimum
   - **How to Avoid**: Commit to daily sharing for 12+ months minimum

4. **Mistake**: Comparing to accounts with 100K+ followers
   - **Why It Fails**: Demotivating, causes quit
   - **How to Avoid**: Track own growth week-over-week, celebrate small wins

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good Fit When:**
- Building indie SaaS or developer tools
- Have 1-3 years before needing distribution
- Comfortable sharing publicly
- Building something genuinely interesting
- Target audience uses Twitter
- Can commit to daily/consistent sharing

❌ **Bad Fit When:**
- Need customers now (no time to build audience)
- Enterprise B2B with long sales cycles
- Target audience not on Twitter (e.g., elderly, specific industries)
- Can't commit to consistent sharing
- Building something secretive/stealthy

## Tactical Tips

**First 100 Followers (Months 0-3)**:
- Share daily what you're learning/building
- Engage with bigger accounts in your niche
- Reply helpfully to others' tweets
- Don't expect growth, focus on habit formation

**100 to 1,000 (Months 3-12)**:
- Find your content style (technical, visual, story-driven)
- Share mini-wins and lessons learned
- Create threads with value (how-to, case studies)
- First viral tweet usually happens here

**1,000 to 10,000 (Year 1-2)**:
- Consistent revenue updates if comfortable
- Share behind-the-scenes of building
- Technical deep-dives if developer audience
- Start seeing distribution value

**10,000+ (Year 2+)**:
- Audience large enough for product launches
- Can drive significant traffic to products
- Word-of-mouth amplification kicks in
- Compounding really shows
