# Lightning-Fast Shipping

**Category:** mvp-building
**Success Rate:** High (first-mover advantage + validation speed)
**Time Investment:** 1-7 days for MVP
**Difficulty:** Hard (requires focus, skills, ruthless prioritization)

## What Is This Pattern?

Ship a minimal viable product in days, not months. Cut everything except core value proposition. Perfect timing + speed beats perfect product + delay.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Core Value**: What's the ONE thing users must have?
2. **Strip Everything Else**: No auth, no database, no polish - absolute minimum
3. **Set Deadline**: 1-7 days maximum
4. **Ship Publicly**: Launch even if embarrassed by simplicity
5. **Iterate Based on Real Users**: Add features users actually request

## Real Examples (Ranked by Speed)

### 1. TypingMind - 3 Days (Tony Dinh → $83K MRR)
- **Context**: ChatGPT API released March 1, needed to be first
- **Execution**:
  - March 1: API announced
  - March 3-5: Built MVP
  - March 6: Launched publicly
  - Core features: Better UI, conversation organization, custom prompts
- **Results**: $1K day 1, $22K in 7 days
- **Key Insight**: 3 days after API = first-mover advantage, captured early adopters

### 2. ShipFast - 7 Days (Marc Lou → $50K MRR)
- **Context**: Had built 23 products, knew exactly what was needed
- **Execution**:
  - Compiled existing code from previous projects
  - One week to package as boilerplate
  - Included: DNS, Stripe, auth, email, database setup
- **Results**: $4K/day, $1.2M+ lifetime revenue
- **Key Insight**: Reusing proven code = extreme speed

### 3. Bank Statement Converter - 1 Week (Angus Cheng → $16K MRR)
- **Context**: Rage-quit job, needed validation fast
- **Execution**:
  - March 2021: Conceived idea
  - April 4: Started building
  - April 17: Launched, first user same day
  - Initial investment: <$100
- **Results**: $101 first month, now $16K/month autopilot
- **Key Insight**: Minimal planning, maximum execution

### 4. Vampire Survivors - 3-4 Months Initial (Luca Galante → £40M)
- **Context**: Unemployed, practice project
- **Execution**:
  - Dec 2020 - Mar 2021: Built browser game
  - March 31, 2021: Free launch on itch.io
  - Failed to get 100 players initially
  - Dec 2021: Ported to Steam ($2.99)
- **Results**: Viral after SplatterCat video, £40M net worth
- **Key Insight**: Even "slower" MVP (3-4 months) still fast for game development

## Why This Works

**First-Mover Advantage**:
- Capture market before competition emerges
- Set standards in new category
- Build audience while others plan

**Validation Speed**:
- Learn what users want in days, not months
- Fail fast if idea doesn't work
- Avoid wasting months on wrong direction

**Authentic Product**:
- Shipping forces focus on core value
- Can't over-engineer if time is limited
- Users see genuine solution, not vaporware

**Momentum**:
- Shipping creates psychological momentum
- Builds "maker muscle memory"
- Reduces perfectionism paralysis

## Prerequisites

- **Skills Required**: Full-stack or ability to build MVP yourself
- **Time Required**: 1-7 days focused work
- **Capital Required**: Minimal (<$100 typical)
- **Other Requirements**:
  - Clear problem definition
  - Ruthless prioritization ability
  - Willingness to ship "embarrassing" v1

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mistake**: "Just one more feature" syndrome
   - **Why It Fails**: Delays launch indefinitely, misses timing window
   - **How to Avoid**: Set hard deadline, ship no matter what

2. **Mistake**: Building auth/database/infrastructure first
   - **Why It Fails**: Wastes time on non-differentiating features
   - **How to Avoid**: Hardcode, use spreadsheets, manual processes initially

3. **Mistake**: Waiting for perfect design/UX
   - **Why It Fails**: Design doesn't matter if product has no users
   - **How to Avoid**: Ugly but functional > beautiful but delayed

4. **Mistake**: Trying to build for everyone
   - **Why It Fails**: Generic product pleases no one
   - **How to Avoid**: Build for yourself or one specific persona

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good Fit When:**
- New market opportunity appears (API release, trend)
- Solving clear, specific problem
- You have full-stack skills or simple scope
- First-mover advantage matters
- Testing idea viability quickly
- Building for yourself (know exactly what's needed)

❌ **Bad Fit When:**
- Complex regulatory requirements (healthcare, finance)
- Safety-critical systems
- Requires extensive partnerships/integrations
- Need significant capital investment first
- Building enterprise B2B (long sales cycles anyway)

## Speed vs Quality Trade-offs

**Ship Fast:**
- Simple SaaS tools
- Developer tools
- Content platforms
- Productivity apps
- Marketplaces (MVP)

**Take Time:**
- Healthcare/medical devices
- Financial infrastructure
- Developer platforms (SDKs need quality)
- Hardware products
- Games (except prototypes)

- **Validation**: [charge-from-day-one](../validation/charge-from-day-one.md) - Ship paid, validate willingness immediately
- **Growth**: [build-in-public](../growth/content-marketing.md#building-in-public) - Share journey as you ship

## Tactical Tips

**Day 1-2: Core Feature Only**
- ONE feature that solves THE problem
- Hardcode everything possible
- No signup/login if not essential
- Manual processes OK

**Day 3-5: Make It Shippable**
- Basic error handling
- Landing page (single page OK)
- Payment integration (Stripe, Gumroad)
- Domain + basic hosting

**Day 6-7: Launch**
- Write launch post
- Share on Twitter, Hacker News, Product Hunt
- Monitor feedback, fix critical bugs
- Resist urge to rebuild - iterate based on users
