# Rapid Prototyping with 3D Printing

**Speed:** Days instead of weeks/months

## What Is This Pattern?

Use 3D printing technology to create functional product prototypes within days instead of weeks or months required by traditional manufacturing. Test market demand with real products before committing to expensive tooling, minimum order quantities, or overseas manufacturing.

**Core Philosophy:** "Just make whatever idea you have exist first, and then make it good later"

## How It Works

**Traditional Manufacturing:**
1. Design product
2. Find manufacturer
3. Create molds/tooling ($5K-$50K+)
4. Minimum order quantity (1,000-10,000 units)
5. Wait 6-12 weeks for production
6. Hope customers want it
7. Stuck with inventory if it fails

**3D Printing Approach:**
1. Design product in CAD software
2. 3D print prototype (hours to days)
3. Test with real customers immediately
4. Iterate based on feedback (print new version)
5. Repeat until validated
6. Scale production with more printers
7. Zero wasted inventory (print on demand)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Waiting for perfect design**
   - "Just make whatever idea you have exist first"
   - Ship v1, iterate based on real feedback
   - Perfection kills speed advantage

2. **Outsourcing too early**
   - In-house = control and flexibility
   - CruiseCup chose 130 printers over injection molding
   - Maintain iteration speed

3. **Comparing to injection molding economics**
   - 3D printing more expensive per unit
   - BUT: No tooling, no minimums, no risk
   - Economics favor small batch, high variety

4. **Not leveraging customization**
   - 3D printing enables mass customization
   - Each product can be unique
   - ActivArmor: custom-fit to each patient
   - Competitive advantage traditional manufacturing can't match

5. **Scaling too fast to traditional manufacturing**
   - Validate first with 3D printing
   - Scale production with more printers
   - Only move to injection molding if truly commodity product
   - CruiseCup stayed with printers even at $300K/month

6. **Using wrong materials**
   - Different filaments for different applications
   - ABS, PLA, PETG, TPU each have uses
   - ActivArmor: ABS plastic (biocompatible, sanitizable)
   - Test materials for your product requirements
