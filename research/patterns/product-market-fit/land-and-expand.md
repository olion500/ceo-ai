# Land-and-Expand

## What Is This Pattern?

Start with small pilot deals (10-50 seats) in organizations, prove value quickly, then expand to hundreds/thousands of seats within the same customer. Prioritize depth over breadth.

## How It Works

1. **Land Small**: Begin with pilot program (10-50 seats in one department)
2. **Prove Value Fast**: Show ROI within 3-6 months
3. **Expand Across Departments**: Success in M&A → Litigation → Corporate
4. **Grow Seat Count**: Pilot users become champions, request more seats
5. **Cross-Sell Products**: Add complementary offerings once embedded

## Real Examples (Ranked by Success)

### 1. Harvey Legal AI - Winston Weinberg ($100M ARR)

- **Context**: Selling AI legal assistant to BigLaw firms and corporates
- **Land Strategy**:
  - Start with 10-50 seats in specific practice area (M&A, fund formation)
  - Target one partner/team as initial champion
  - 3-6 month pilot to prove value
- **Expand Execution**:
  - Success in one practice area → other partners request access
  - 10-50 seats → hundreds of seats per firm
  - Single product (Assistant) → 4-product suite (Vault, Knowledge, Workflows)
- **Results**:
  - 558% YoY revenue growth in 2024
  - 8 of 10 highest-grossing US law firms
  - Revenue mix shift: 96% law firms → 60% law firms + 40% corporates
  - Firms expanding from tens to hundreds of seats
- **Key Quote**: "You'll sell to a Comcast or to a law firm, and they'll buy a couple hundred seats, and then they expand that usage pretty quickly"
- **Outcome**: $100M ARR with only 500 customers (high ACV from expansion)

### 2. 11x AI - Hasan Sukkar ($25M ARR)

- **Context**: AI sales automation for enterprise sales teams
- **Land Strategy**:
  - Small initial deployment in one sales team
  - Prove ROI with metrics (response rates, meeting bookings)
- **Expand Execution**:
  - Success in one team → other teams request access
  - Upsell from automation to full AI sales workers
- **Results**:
  - $0 → $1M ARR in 5 months
  - $1M → $25M ARR in 22 more months
- **Key Insight**: Fast initial proof (5 months to $1M) enabled rapid expansion

## Why This Works

**For the Vendor:**

- Lower initial CAC (easier to sell small pilots)
- Expansion revenue has near-zero CAC
- High net revenue retention (>120% typical)
- Predictable upsell motions

**For the Customer:**

- Low-risk pilot reduces procurement friction
- Prove value before committing large budgets
- Internal champions drive organic expansion
- Gradual rollout easier than big-bang deployment

**Network Effects Within Organization:**

- Users become advocates
- FOMO drives other teams to adopt
- Shared workflows create lock-in
- More users = more valuable (collaboration features)

## Prerequisites

- **Product Requirements**:
  - Works well at small scale (pilot viable)
  - Clear ROI measurable in 3-6 months
  - Collaboration/network effects that increase value with more users
  - Multi-product expansion opportunity
- **Sales Requirements**:
  - Enterprise sales team that can navigate large orgs
  - Customer success to ensure pilot wins
  - Expansion playbook for scaling within accounts
- **Time Requirements**: 12-24 months to see full expansion potential
- **Capital Requirements**: Patient capital (expansion revenue comes later)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mistake**: Setting minimum deal size too high
   - **Why It Fails**: Blocks pilot deals, slows land motion
   - **How to Avoid**: Allow 10-50 seat pilots even if unprofitable initially

2. **Mistake**: No customer success during pilot
   - **Why It Fails**: Pilot doesn't prove value, no expansion
   - **How to Avoid**: White-glove support during pilot phase

3. **Mistake**: Waiting for customer to request expansion
   - **Why It Fails**: Leaves money on table, slow growth
   - **How to Avoid**: Proactive expansion playbook (monthly check-ins, usage metrics, champion identification)

4. **Mistake**: Expanding before pilot proves clear ROI
   - **Why It Fails**: Weak foundation leads to churn later
   - **How to Avoid**: Define success metrics upfront, only expand after hitting them

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good Fit When:**

- Selling to large organizations (enterprises, law firms, hospitals, etc.)
- Product has network effects or collaboration features
- Clear ROI measurable quickly (3-6 months)
- Long sales cycles justify patience
- High potential ACV from full deployment

❌ **Bad Fit When:**

- SMB/mid-market (organizations too small to expand within)
- Product is single-user tool (no expansion opportunity)
- ROI takes years to prove (can't validate pilot fast enough)
- Winner-take-all market (need to land everywhere fast)

## Expansion Playbook

**Months 0-3 (Pilot Launch)**:

- Define success metrics with customer upfront
- Weekly check-ins with pilot team
- Track usage, satisfaction, early wins
- Identify champion within pilot group

**Months 3-6 (Prove Value)**:

- Hit success metrics, document ROI
- Case study/internal testimonial from pilot team
- Identify next department for expansion

**Months 6-12 (First Expansion)**:

- Expand to 2-3x pilot size
- Add second product/feature tier
- Build relationships with other departments
- Create internal champions network

**Months 12-24 (Scale Within Account)**:

- Expand to majority of organization
- Cross-sell additional products
- Executive sponsor relationship
- Strategic partnership discussions

## Metrics to Track

**Land Metrics:**

- Pilot conversion rate (demo → pilot deal)
- Time to pilot close
- Pilot deal size (seats)
- Initial ACV

**Expand Metrics:**

- Net Revenue Retention (NRR) - Target >120%
- Expansion timeline (pilot → full deployment)
- Seat growth rate within accounts
- Product attach rate (single → multi-product)
- Champion engagement score

**Harvey's Expansion Metrics:**

- 558% YoY growth (driven by expansion)
- 500 customers at $100M ARR = $200K average ACV
- Weekly active users quadrupled (engagement growth)
