# Alternative-Anchored Pricing

## What Is This Pattern?

Price your product based on the **cost of the alternative** users currently use, NOT based on competitor pricing or arbitrary SaaS tiers.

**Core principle:** Capture a fraction of the value you create by replacing what users do WITHOUT your product.

## How It Works

### Traditional Pricing (Wrong)

```text
❌ Look at competitor pricing
❌ Pick $9/$29/$99 tiers arbitrarily
❌ Add 20% because you're "premium"
❌ Copy Y Combinator pricing advice
```

**Problem:** No rational justification. Can't defend in sales conversations.

### Alternative-Anchored Pricing (Right)

**Step 1: Identify the Alternative**
What do users do RIGHT NOW without your product?

- Manual work?
- Hire someone?
- Use multiple tools?
- Just don't solve the problem?

**Step 2: Calculate Alternative Cost**

```text
Time cost:
- Hours spent × Hourly rate = $X

Money cost:
- Service fees
- Software subscriptions
- Contractor rates
= $Y

Total Alternative Cost = $X + $Y
```

**Step 3: Price Below Alternative, Above Cost**

```text
Alternative cost: $100
Your pricing: $40-70 (40-70% of alternative)

Captured value: You save them $30-60
Your margin: Must be profitable at $40+
```

**Step 4: Validate with ICP**
Test pricing with Ideal Customer Profile:

- Surveys: "Would you pay $X?"
- Interviews: "How much do you spend today?"
- A/B tests: Different price points

## Real Examples (Ranked by Success)

### 1. OpusClip - AI Video Clipping ($215M valuation, 50M users)

**Step 1: Identified Alternative**
Users currently pay video editors to create short clips from long content.

**Step 2: Calculated Alternative Cost**

- 1 clip = 30-60 minutes professional editing time
- Market rate for video editors: $25-50/hour
- **Per clip cost: $25-50**

**Step 3: Anchored Pricing**
OpusClip pricing positioned at:

- Estimated: ~$1-5 per AI-generated clip
- Bulk plans: Lower per-clip cost with volume
- Enterprise: Custom pricing but still anchored to alternative

**Results:**

- Easy sales conversation: "We save you $20-45 per clip"
- Rational justification: Not arbitrary SaaS tiers
- Natural segmentation: High-volume creators see massive ROI

**Key insight (Young Zhao):**
> "Price based on the value they replaced, not arbitrary competitor pricing."

**Metrics:**

- $215M valuation
- 50M users
- Business model sustainability proven by scale

### 2. Common Pattern: Calendly

**Alternative Cost:**

- Email back-and-forth: 5-10 emails × 3 min each = 15-30 min
- Executive assistant time: $25-50/hour
- **Per meeting scheduled: $6-25 in time cost**

**Calendly Pricing:**

- Free tier: Basic (loss leader)
- Pro: $8/month (if you schedule 10+ meetings/month, saves $60-250)
- Teams: $12/user (enterprise time savings)

**Why it works:** ROI is instant and obvious to users

### 3. Grammarly

**Alternative Cost:**

- Professional editor: $30-100/hour
- Average document: 30-60 min review
- **Per document: $15-100**

**Grammarly Pricing:**

- Free: Basic (acquisition)
- Premium: $12/month (unlimited checks)
- Business: $15/user/month (if editing >2 docs/month, massive savings)

**Why it works:** Clear before/after value calculation

## Why This Works

### 1. Rational Sales Conversations

**Without alternative anchoring:**

- Prospect: "Why $99/month?"
- You: "Uh, that's industry standard?"
- Prospect: "Seems expensive"

**With alternative anchoring:**

- Prospect: "Why $99/month?"
- You: "You currently spend $500/month on [alternative]. We save you $400."
- Prospect: "When can we start?"

### 2. Natural Customer Segmentation

Price-sensitive customers:

- Low alternative cost → Won't pay much → Small plans

Value-focused customers:

- High alternative cost → Will pay premium → Enterprise plans

**The market self-segments based on actual value received.**

### 3. Justifies Premium Pricing

If your product replaces:

- ❌ $5/month tool → Hard to charge $99
- ✅ $5,000/month service → Easy to charge $1,500

Alternative anchor sets the ceiling.

### 4. Reduces Price Objections

Users arguing about price are really arguing about value:

- "Too expensive" = "I don't see value"
- Alternative anchor makes value concrete

**Example:**
"You spend 10 hours/month on [task] at $50/hour = $500. We charge $99 and save you 9 hours. Net savings: $350/month."

Hard to argue with math.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Clear understanding of what users do WITHOUT your product
- Access to target users for pricing research
- Product that REPLACES something (not creates new behavior)

**Helpful:**

- Industry reports on service costs
- Salary data for roles you're replacing
- Competitor pricing (for reference, not copying)

**Not useful for:**

- Net-new behaviors (no alternative exists)
- Pure innovation plays (no current solution)
- Platform businesses (network effects, not replacement value)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Anchoring to Wrong Alternative

**Wrong:** OpusClip compares to Final Cut Pro ($300)
**Right:** OpusClip compares to hiring video editor ($25-50/clip)

**Key:** Anchor to what users ACTUALLY DO, not what they COULD do

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Accounting for Switching Costs

**Wrong:** Alternative costs $100, you charge $95 (only $5 savings)
**Right:** Alternative costs $100, you charge $60-70 (must save $30+ to justify switch)

**Rule of thumb:** 30-50% savings to overcome switching friction

### ❌ Mistake #3: Anchoring to Cheapest Alternative

**Wrong:** Some people use free Canva, so price near $0
**Right:** ICP pays designers $50/hour, price based on that

**Key:** Anchor to what your IDEAL customers pay, not everyone

### ❌ Mistake #4: Ignoring Time Value

**Wrong:** Only count money cost of alternative
**Right:** Time saved × Hourly rate = Additional value

**Example:**

- Alternative service: $50
- Takes 3 hours to use
- Your product: Same outcome in 10 minutes
- Real value: $50 + (2.83 hours × $30/hour) = $135

### ❌ Mistake #5: One-Size-Fits-All Pricing

**Wrong:** Everyone pays $99 regardless of usage
**Right:** Tier pricing based on alternative cost at each scale

**Example:**

- 10 clips/month: $29 (alternative: $250-500)
- 100 clips/month: $199 (alternative: $2,500-5,000)
- 1000+ clips/month: Enterprise (alternative: Full-time editor $4K+)

## When to Use This Pattern

### ✅ Perfect for

- **Productivity tools** - Replace manual work (clear time savings)
- **AI automation** - Replace human services (editors, designers, analysts)
- **Vertical SaaS** - Replace industry-specific services
- **Dev tools** - Replace engineering time (hours saved × salary)

### ⚠️ Use with caution

- **Network effects products** - Value increases with users, hard to anchor
- **Social products** - Alternative is "nothing," hard to price
- **Pure innovation** - No current alternative to anchor to

### ❌ Don't use for

- **Marketplaces** - Take percentage of transaction value
- **Entertainment** - Value is subjective, not replacement
- **Platforms** - Network effects create value, not replacement

## Pricing Research Framework

### Step 1: Alternative Discovery Interviews (Week 1)

Interview 20-30 target users:

**Questions:**

1. "How do you solve [problem] today?"
2. "How much time does it take?"
3. "Do you pay for any tools/services for this?"
4. "If you hired someone, what would it cost?"
5. "What's your hourly rate (or team's average)?"

**Goal:** Build Alternative Cost Matrix

### Step 2: Calculate Cost Ranges

```markdown
| User Segment | Alternative | Time | Money | Total Alt Cost |
|--------------|-------------|------|-------|----------------|
| Solo creator | Manual edit | 2h   | $0    | $60 (at $30/h) |
| Small team   | Contractor  | 1h   | $50   | $80            |
| Enterprise   | FTE editor  | -    | $4K/m | $4,000/month   |
```

### Step 3: Set Pricing Tiers

For each segment, price at 40-70% of alternative:

```markdown
| Segment      | Alt Cost   | Your Price | Savings |
|--------------|------------|------------|---------|
| Solo creator | $60/task   | $29/month  | $31+    |
| Small team   | $80/task   | $199/month | $400+   |
| Enterprise   | $4K/month  | $1.5K/mo   | $2.5K   |
```

### Step 4: Validate with Price Sensitivity Survey

Ask users:

- "At what price is this a no-brainer?" (floor)
- "At what price is this expensive but worth it?" (optimal)
- "At what price is this too expensive?" (ceiling)

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity:**

- "Too cheap" point
- "Bargain" point ← Optimal range
- "Expensive but fair" point ← Optimal range
- "Too expensive" point
