# Productized Service

## What Is This Pattern?

Convert service expertise into fixed-price monthly subscriptions instead of hourly billing. Package your skills as an "unlimited" or "fixed deliverables" offering with predictable monthly pricing.

## How It Works

1. **Package Your Expertise**: Define what you deliver monthly (e.g., "unlimited design")
2. **Fixed Pricing Tiers**: Replace hourly rates with monthly subscription ($1K-5K/month)
3. **Scope Management**: Set clear boundaries (e.g., "2-day turnaround per request")
4. **Predictable Revenue**: Clients pay monthly, you know recurring income
5. **Scale Through Efficiency**: Your speed determines client capacity

## Real Examples (Ranked by Success)

### 1. Designfly - Brad Adkins ($10K MRR in 18 months)
- **Context**: 10-year design veteran tired of feast-or-famine freelancing
- **Execution**:
  - Unlimited UI/UX design for SaaS startups
  - Monthly subscription: $1,000-1,900/month (avg $1,750)
  - Delivery options: 1-day or 2-day turnaround per deliverable
  - Initial pricing mistake: $3,700-4,900 (too high, adjusted down)
  - Roasti lead gen tool (free design feedback → paid conversions)
- **Results**:
  - Month 1: $4.9K MRR (immediate traction)
  - Month 18: $10K MRR
  - 8-10 concurrent clients (capacity limit)
  - 1-2 hours per deliverable (10-year experience = speed)
- **Key Insight**: Fixed pricing eliminates negotiation, predictable income beats freelance chaos

## Why This Works

**For the Founder:**
- Predictable recurring revenue (vs project-based feast/famine)
- Higher perceived value than hourly (charge for outcomes not time)
- Scalable to extent of personal capacity
- No client acquisition per project (retain clients monthly)

**For the Client:**
- Predictable monthly expense (easier budgeting)
- Faster than hiring full-time employee
- No negotiation friction (transparent pricing)
- Cancel anytime flexibility

**Market Dynamics:**
- Sweet spot between freelancing (unpredictable) and agency (expensive)
- Recurring revenue creates business value (sellable asset)
- Client LTV much higher than project-based work

## Prerequisites

- **Skills Required**:
  - Deep expertise in productized skill (5-10+ years experience)
  - Fast execution (experience → speed → capacity)
  - Client communication and scope management
- **Time Required**: Can start immediately with existing skills
- **Capital Required**: Minimal ($0-1K for website/tools)
- **Other Requirements**:
  - Existing work samples/portfolio
  - Clear positioning (who you serve + what you deliver)
  - Ability to work solo or manage small team

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mistake**: Pricing too high initially without market validation
   - **Why It Fails**: No sales at $4,900/month even if value justifies it
   - **How to Avoid**: Start at market rate ($1-2K for design), test willingness-to-pay
   - **Designfly Example**: $3,700-4,900 failed → $1,000-1,900 succeeded

2. **Mistake**: "Unlimited" without scope boundaries
   - **Why It Fails**: Clients abuse unlimited, you burn out
   - **How to Avoid**: Define turnaround time (forces pacing), cap revisions

3. **Mistake**: Taking too many clients for capacity
   - **Why It Fails**: Quality declines, burnout follows
   - **How to Avoid**: Know your limit (Designfly: 8-10 max), waitlist beyond that

4. **Mistake**: Competing on price instead of value
   - **Why It Fails**: Race to bottom, can't sustain quality
   - **How to Avoid**: Position on speed/quality, not cheapest option

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good Fit When:**
- You have 5-10+ years expertise in marketable skill
- Skill is high-demand and repeatable (design, development, writing, etc.)
- You're fast due to experience (can serve 5-10+ clients monthly)
- Want recurring revenue without building software
- Target market is startups/SMBs (not enterprises)

❌ **Bad Fit When:**
- You're early in career (slow execution = can't serve enough clients)
- Skill is highly variable (can't standardize delivery)
- Target market prefers project-based (e.g., large enterprises)
- You want passive income (this is active work)
- Can't commit to ongoing client relationships

## Pricing Strategy

**Finding Your Sweet Spot:**

| Monthly Price | Market Segment | Typical Client Load |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| $500-1,000 | Budget-conscious startups | 10-20 clients needed for $10K MRR |
| $1,000-2,500 | Growth startups (sweet spot) | 5-10 clients for $10K MRR |
| $2,500-5,000 | Established companies | 2-4 clients for $10K MRR |
| $5,000+ | Enterprise/custom | 1-2 clients but harder to close |

**Designfly's Pricing Journey:**
- Initial: $3,700-4,900/month ❌ (too high, slow sales)
- Adjusted: $1,000-1,900/month ✅ (explosive growth)
- Average: $1,750/month (sweet spot discovered)

## Scaling Options

**Once You Hit Capacity Ceiling:**

1. **Raise Prices**: $1,750 → $3,000+ (fewer clients, same revenue)
2. **Hire Team**: Add designers, increase capacity
3. **Add Tiers**: Basic ($1K) → Premium ($3K) → Enterprise ($5K+)
4. **Automate/Productize**: Turn processes into SaaS tools
5. **Create Courses**: Teach others your methodology
6. **Build Waitlist**: Create scarcity, raise prices

**Designfly's Current Constraint:**
- 8-10 clients = max capacity at current pricing
- Options: Raise prices OR hire team OR maintain as lifestyle business
