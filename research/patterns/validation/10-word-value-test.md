# 10-Word Value Test

## What Is This Pattern?

If you can't explain your core value proposition in 10 words or less, your positioning isn't clear enough.

**Core principle:** Clarity drives conversion. Confusion drives bounce.

## How It Works

### The Test

```text
Can you explain what your product does in ≤10 words?

❌ Fail: Needs context, use cases, or examples to explain
✅ Pass: Stranger understands value immediately
```

### Why 10 Words?

**Short enough to:**

- Fit in elevator pitch
- Remember and repeat (word-of-mouth)
- Use in ad copy (character limits)
- Test with strangers (low attention span)

**Long enough to:**

- Convey actual value (not just category)
- Differentiate from competitors
- Include outcome (not just features)

## Real Examples (Ranked by Success)

### 1. OpusClip - AI Video Clipping ($215M valuation, 50M users)

**OpusClip's 10-word value prop:**
> "Turn long videos into viral short clips automatically"

**Word count:** 8 words ✅

**Why it works:**

- Input: Long videos (clear starting point)
- Output: Viral short clips (desired outcome)
- Mechanism: Automatically (the value)
- No jargon, no confusion

**Results:**

- $215M valuation
- 50M users who understood value immediately
- High organic growth (easy to explain = easy to share)

**Young Zhao's framework:**

1. Can explain in ≤10 words? → Close to PMF
2. People say "amazing" but don't ask pricing? → False positive
3. Demo gets credit cards? → Real product

**OpusClip passed all 3 tests**

### 2. Calendly - Meeting Scheduler

**Value prop:**
> "Schedule meetings without the back-and-forth emails"

**Word count:** 7 words ✅

**Why it works:**

- Pain: Back-and-forth emails (everyone feels this)
- Solution: Schedule meetings (clear outcome)
- Mechanism: Without emails (the magic)

### 3. Stripe - Payment Processing

**Value prop:**
> "Payments infrastructure for the internet"

**Word count:** 5 words ✅

**Why it works:**

- What: Payments infrastructure (clear category)
- For whom: The internet (broad but specific)
- Simple, memorable, shareable

### 4. Notion - Knowledge Management

**Value prop:**
> "All-in-one workspace for notes, docs, and databases"

**Word count:** 8 words ✅

**Why it works:**

- Consolidation: All-in-one (key value)
- Use cases: Notes, docs, databases (specific)
- Category: Workspace (clear framing)

### 5. Common Failures (Before Iteration)

**Dropbox (early attempt):**
> "Cloud-based file synchronization and collaboration platform with advanced sharing capabilities"

**Word count:** 11 words ❌ (and full of jargon)

**Dropbox (after iteration):**
> "Your files, anywhere"

**Word count:** 3 words ✅

## Why This Works

### 1. Clarity = Conversion

**Confused visitors:**

- Read value prop → Don't understand → Leave
- Conversion rate: 1-3%

**Clear visitors:**

- Read value prop → Understand immediately → Sign up
- Conversion rate: 5-15%

**5x difference from clarity alone**

### 2. Word-of-Mouth Growth

**Complex value prop:**

- User: "It's like... uh... you know how... it's hard to explain"
- Friend: "Sounds complicated, not interested"
- Viral coefficient: <1

**Simple value prop:**

- User: "Turns long videos into viral clips automatically"
- Friend: "Oh I need that, what's it called?"
- Viral coefficient: >1

### 3. Forces Product Focus

**If you can't explain it simply:**

- Product probably does too many things
- No clear core value
- Diluted positioning

**10-word test forces:**

- Identify ONE core value
- Remove unnecessary features from messaging
- Focus on outcome, not features

### 4. Testable with Strangers

**Friends/family:**

- Too polite to say "I don't get it"
- Fake understanding

**Strangers:**

- Brutal honesty
- If they don't get it, they say so

**Test with strangers = real validation**

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Clear understanding of core value you deliver
- Willingness to iterate (most fail first attempt)
- Access to strangers for testing (coffee shops, online communities)

**Helpful:**

- Customer interviews (understand how THEY describe value)
- Competitor research (avoid sounding the same)
- Writing skills (conciseness is hard)

**Not required:**

- Marketing background
- Large budget
- Polished brand

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Feature List Instead of Value

**Wrong:**
> "AI-powered video editing with smart clipping and multi-platform export"

**Word count:** 10 words, but NO VALUE STATED

**Right:**
> "Turn long videos into viral short clips automatically"

**Focuses on OUTCOME (viral clips) not FEATURES (AI-powered)**

### ❌ Mistake #2: Jargon and Buzzwords

**Wrong:**
> "Leveraging ML to democratize content creation workflows"

**Problems:**

- "Leveraging" (corporate speak)
- "ML" (tech jargon)
- "Democratize" (buzzword)
- "Workflows" (vague)

**Right:**
> "Turn long videos into short clips automatically"

**Plain English anyone can understand**

### ❌ Mistake #3: Explaining HOW Before WHAT

**Wrong:**
> "Using GPT-4 to help you create video clips"

**Focuses on tech (GPT-4) before value**

**Right:**
> "Turn long videos into viral clips automatically"

**Focuses on transformation (long → short, viral)**

### ❌ Mistake #4: Too Broad

**Wrong:**
> "The future of content creation"

**Could mean ANYTHING**

**Right:**
> "Turn long videos into viral short clips"

**Specific input, specific output**

### ❌ Mistake #5: Needs Context

**Wrong:**
"Clips that actually go viral"

**Questions:**

- Clips from what? (needs context)
- For whom? (unclear)

**Right:**
"Turn long videos into viral short clips automatically"

**Self-explanatory, no context needed**

## When to Use This Pattern

### ✅ Perfect for

- **B2C SaaS** - Need instant clarity for self-serve signups
- **PLG (Product-Led Growth)** - No sales team to explain value
- **Viral products** - Users need to explain to others easily
- **Crowded markets** - Differentiation through clarity

### ⚠️ Use with caution

- **Complex enterprise software** - 10 words may be too limiting
- **Platform businesses** - Multiple value props for different sides
- **Novel categories** - Might need education before value prop

### ❌ Don't use for

- **Developer tools** - Technical audience expects detail
- **Services** - Custom solutions, hard to generalize
- **Deep tech** - May need explanation of technology first

## The 10-Word Value Test Process

### Step 1: Draft Initial Attempt (15 minutes)

Template options:

**Transformation template:**
> "Turn [input] into [output] [mechanism]"
- OpusClip: Turn long videos into viral clips automatically

**Problem-solution template:**
> "[Do thing] without [pain point]"
- Calendly: Schedule meetings without email back-and-forth

**Outcome template:**
> "[Desired outcome] for [who]"
- Stripe: Payments infrastructure for the internet

**Your draft:**
> "**_****_****_****_****_****_****_**___"

**Word count:** ___

### Step 2: Test with 10 Strangers (Day 1)

Find people who DON'T know your product:

- Coffee shop
- Subreddit
- Twitter DM
- Random Zoom call

**Script:**
"I'm testing a value prop. Can I read you one sentence and you tell me what you think the product does?"

[Read 10-word value prop]

"What do you think it does?"

**Pass criteria:**

- 7/10 people explain it correctly = PASS
- <7/10 = ITERATE

### Step 3: Iterate (Days 2-3)

**Common fixes:**

**If they don't understand the category:**

- Add category: "Workflow tool that..."
- Add context: "For content creators who..."

**If they confuse with competitor:**

- Add differentiator: "...without code"
- Add mechanism: "...automatically"

**If too vague:**

- Add specificity: "...for video podcasts"
- Add outcome: "...that go viral"

**Re-test after each iteration**

### Step 4: Validate with Metrics (Week 1)

**A/B test on landing page:**

Version A: Your 10-word value prop
Version B: Old value prop

**Measure:**

- Bounce rate (should drop)
- Time on page (should increase)
- Signup rate (should increase)

**If new version wins: You passed the test**

## Clarity Checklist

Does your 10-word value prop:

**Structure:**

- [ ] 10 words or less?
- [ ] Complete sentence?
- [ ] No jargon or buzzwords?
- [ ] Plain English (8th grade reading level)?

**Content:**

- [ ] States WHAT (not HOW)?
- [ ] Clear outcome/benefit?
- [ ] Specific enough to differentiate?
- [ ] Broad enough for target market?

**Validation:**

- [ ] Strangers understand immediately?
- [ ] Can be repeated from memory?
- [ ] Different from competitors?
- [ ] Makes people ask "how does it work?" (not "what does it do?")?

**If 10+ checkboxes: You have clarity**

## Failure Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-pattern #1: Thesis Statement

**Wrong:**
> "We believe content creation should be accessible to everyone"

**This is a MISSION, not a VALUE PROP**

### Anti-pattern #2: Category Only

**Wrong:**
> "The best video editing platform"

**Too generic, no differentiation**

### Anti-pattern #3: Aspirational Fluff

**Wrong:**
> "Empower creators to reach their full potential"

**Sounds nice, means nothing**

### Anti-pattern #4: Feature Soup

**Wrong:**
> "Video editing, clipping, publishing, and analytics all-in-one"

**Lists features, not outcome**

### Anti-pattern #5: Question Format

**Wrong:**
> "Want to create viral clips from your videos?"

**Doesn't state WHAT the product is**

## Related Patterns

**Precedes this pattern:**

- **Manual-First Validation** (validation/) - Understand value before articulating it
- **Alternative-Anchored Pricing** (monetization/) - Know what you're replacing

**Combines well with:**

- **Credit Card Test** (validation/) - Clarity drives conversion
- **Complaint-Based PMF** (pmf/) - Both fight vanity metrics

**Leads to:**

- **Product Hunt Launch** (customer-acquisition/) - Clear value prop = viral launch
- **Community-Led Growth** (growth/) - Easy to explain = easy to share

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

**🚩 Red flags (iterate more):**

- Need to explain context before value prop
- People say "interesting..." (confused)
- Can't remember it 5 minutes later
- Sounds like 10 other competitors
- Uses jargon (ML, AI, blockchain, etc.)

**✅ Green flags (you have clarity):**

- Strangers repeat it back correctly
- People immediately ask "how?" (not "what?")
- Users explain product to others using your words
- Works in 280-character tweet
- Differentiated from competitors

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Draft 10-word value prop using templates
- [ ] Count words (must be ≤10)
- [ ] Remove jargon and buzzwords
- [ ] Test with 10 strangers
- [ ] Iterate based on confusion points
- [ ] Re-test until 7/10 understand correctly
- [ ] A/B test on landing page
- [ ] Measure signup conversion increase
- [ ] Use in all marketing (ads, social, emails)
- [ ] Train team to use same language

## Advanced: The 3-Word Test

**After passing 10-word test, try 3-word:**

**OpusClip:**

- 10-word: "Turn long videos into viral short clips automatically"
- 3-word: "Videos to clips"
- Even clearer for paid ads

**Calendly:**

- 10-word: "Schedule meetings without email back-and-forth"
- 3-word: "Easy scheduling"

**Stripe:**

- 10-word: Already 5 words ("Payments infrastructure for the internet")
- 3-word: "Internet payments"

**3-word test = ultimate clarity**

  - 8-word value prop: "Turn long videos into viral short clips automatically"
  - Young Zhao framework: Can you explain value in ≤10 words?
  - If can't: Positioning not clear enough
  - If can: Close to PMF (if combined with other signals)
  - $215M valuation, 50M users

- **Positioning Theory:**
  - April Dunford: "Obviously Awesome" (clarity drives conversion)
  - Donald Miller: "StoryBrand" (clear message = business growth)
  - Copy length studies: Shorter = higher recall, sharing

- **Common across successful startups:**
  - Calendly, Stripe, Notion, Dropbox all passed this test
  - Clear value props = easier fundraising, hiring, selling
